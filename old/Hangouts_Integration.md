## Creating and Inviting Users to a Hangout On Air

Hangout On Air debates require multiple steps to properly set up and
run.

To create a Hangout On Air:

1: Log into your Google account: <https://accounts.google.com/>

2: Go to the Google Hangouts On Air page
(https://plus.google.com/u/0/hangouts/onair)

3: Create a Hangout on Air:

- Give the Hangout on Air a Name and Description, and then set the Date
  and Time
- The Audience can be left “public‘. You can also add emails for other
  people you wish to watch the debate. This sets who can watch the
  Hangout On Air, participants are invited later
- **Note:** when creating your first Hangout On Air you will need to
  verify your youtube account. Follow the instructions Google provides
  to do this
- Click the “Share” link to finalize the process and create the Hangout
  on Air

4: You will then be taken to your new Hangout on Air page. This is the
page that people can visit to view the debate You can optionally copy
the URL of this page and paste it into Tabroom to send to participants,
but this link will not allow them to join. It will only allow them to
watch. To allow users to Join you will need to send another email right
before you are ready to start the the debate.

**To following outlines how to get the URL allowing Tabroom members to
join the debate.**

**An Important Note:** The link to invite participants to join the
Hangout On Air is generated when the Hangout On Air is officially
started. The invitation email that Google provides when creating the
events (but before it’s actual start), only allows people to VIEW the
Hangout On Air.

*We recommend starting the Hangout On Air, and inviting users at least a
minimum of a 35 minutes before the scheduled broadcast.*

Once the event has been started, the invite link should be input into
the Tabroom event, and then sent.
