To get started paneling prelims in Congress or Speech, use the "Rounds"
menu item. You will then be given the option to panel all speech events
at once (recommended), or one at a time:

If you choose the "Mass Attack" option, you will see a list of events,
where you can choose the number of sections to create. Tabroom will try
to evenly distribute entries through the number of sections you choose -
so the more sections you use, the smaller the average section size will
be.

If instead of "Mass Attack," you choose to panel a single event, you
will see a similar screen that lets you choose the number of sections to
use for each round.

If you need more control over the pairing process, you also have the
option of paneling only a single round, direct from the schematic. Use
the Schemats menu to view the round you want to pair, then select "Panel
this round only" from the sidebar to automatically panel that round. If
you instead first create the number of sections you want to use with the
"Create additional sections" box, the auto-paneler will split up
students into that number of sections.
