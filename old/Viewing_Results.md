To view online ballots after a tournament (Or during, if they're being
published as you go:)

1\. Log into your tabroom account and go to your school record. Then hit
the "Results" tab at the top. Or if the tournament is over, for a while
it appears in your tournament listing with a red Results button instead
of a blue Entry button.

3\. On the right are a number of options. If a tournament is publishing
results round by round to coaches only, your results will be visible
under the Show Ballots button. Click the eye symbol next to each
competitor to see their written critiques or points/results:

4\. The Show Results button will be where aggregate results are posted,
such as "Entries in Order" style results. They probably will not be
available until the conclusion of the tournament.
