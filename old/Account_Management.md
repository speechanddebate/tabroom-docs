## Adding phonetic spellings for name pronunciation

Competitors may now enter their own pronunciation guide to help others
pronounce their names if their coaches have not already done so.

Follow these steps to add phonetic spellings:

1\. Select the profile button on the top right corner of the homepage of
Tabroom.com.

3\. Competitors should now see a text box to enter a phonetic spelling
next to the student name (e.g. Kev-on Haugh-ton). If a student is
affiliated with multiple institutions, they should add this to all of
their contestant records on various rosters (see below).

The pronunciation guide will appear whenever the tournament staff prints
an awards script

Students can retroactively change the way their name appears on past
judge and competitor records in Tabroom. Tabroom Forum post explanation
