Use the Results/NSDA Points tab to post merit points at the conclusion
of your tournament. These will post automatically once the tournament
ends, but you can post them immediately once an event has ended.

**Update - Auto-posting of NSDA points in rounds with two judge panels
does not configure correctly. Coaches will need to manually enter points
for those rounds.**
