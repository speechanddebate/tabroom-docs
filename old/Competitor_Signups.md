The signup system, new in fall of 2017, allows you to do away with that
sheet of paper in the corner of your classroom where competitors
illegibly sign up for tournaments. This feature lets the coach only have
to confirm the entry data the competitor has input in, and it also
notifies debate/duo partners, as well as parents, at the time a
competitor signs them up. You can put in tournament travel and logistic
data either in raw text directly in Tabroom, or provide a document memo
that the system will send to everyone. Then, when you're ready, simply
confirm or reject the entries and they will be registered into the
tournament. The system will also allow you to transfer a TBA or
registered slot onto a signed up slot, to manage tournaments with entry
caps and wait-lists.

## Linking Parents

You can set parents to follow their student competitors, so they receive
tournament memos automatically. Doing so also permits you to later
easily email all the parents of students going to a particular
tournament. To do so, go to your school's Competitors tab, when you
first log in. Click on "Parent Notifications" at right.

</figure>

Then next to each competitor, you can see who is already set to follow a
student's notifications, click the trash icon to remove them, or to
enter their email address to set them to follow. Parent notification
recipients do NOT need to have a Tabroom.com account; just a simple
email will do. You can also see this information by clicking on a
competitor on your main roster; this screen just lets you see them all
at once:

<figcaption><a

</figure>

Once linked parents will be notified with a short email informing them
they are linked and what Tabroom.com is and why they're getting emailed
from it.

### Competitors linking parents

You can also have competitors register their own parents for updates, to
make it easier on those with large squads. Students must have a
Tabroom.com account linked to their student record first. When they log
in, they should find at right a section labeled Competing, and after
that can click on Parent Notifications at right.

<figcaption><a
href="File:student-step-ss1.png">File:student-step-ss1.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Students can add parents or delete them at any time, but parents will be
notified when they do so. If for some reason you wish to delete a parent
notification recipient without notification, a coach can delete their
email without notification.

## Set up tournament signup sheet

To set up your tournament signup sheet, click Register on the tournament
like any other, and click on the new Signups tab.

Here, you must first specify a Signup Deadline; competitor signups will
be available until this deadline, and competitors can also withdraw
their entries by this deadline. Competitors cannot withdraw entries that
you have accepted and registered, however.

<img src="create-singup-step1.png"
title="File:create-singup-step1.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:create-singup-step1.png">File:create-singup-step1.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Your signup deadline must be before the tournament's own registration
deadline, naturally, You can also set options on whether to show the
students entry and registration fees, and whether the info and memo you
upload should be automatically sent to parents once they sign up.
Finally you can upload a info document and/or put tournament logistics
information that everyone should know into the Message box. Once you
save a tournament deadline, you will get a new switch to enable the
signup sheet. This switch enables you to turn on the signup sheet; it
can also be turned off at any time before the deadline as you wish.

## Competitor Signups

Competitors logging into Tabroom will now see the tournament available
to sign up when they first log in now under "Tournament Signups Open."

<figure>
<img src="student-signup-step1.png"
title="File:student-signup-step1.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:student-signup-step1.png">File:student-signup-step1.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

They can sign up using the blue Add icon at right, and will be given the
tournament information and logistics you uploaded, and a selection menu
for events they can register into.

<figure>
<img src="student-signup-step2.png"
title="File:student-signup-step2.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:student-signup-step2.png">File:student-signup-step2.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Once they select an event, if the event requires more information (a
partner's name, or tournaments that require information such as piece
titles or authors in interp), the system will ask them for it.

title="File:student-signup-step3.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:student-signup-step3.png">File:student-signup-step3.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Then, once they have registered for a few events, their information and
status will be available to them on their signup page.

## Approval of Signup Entries

Now once you have some signups, go back to your tournament registration
page, and click Signups again. Instead of the Settings button you will
be brought to the Signups button, which will list your competitors who
have signed up, who signed them up, for which events, and when. Next to
each competitor you have a couple of options:

<figure>
<img src="approval-page-step1.png"
title="File:approval-page-step1.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:approval-page-step1.png">File:approval-page-step1.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

At the top of the page, you have the option to simply accept all
signups; use this to register all entries into the tournament
immediately.

On each row, you have the option to Transfer a slot to a competitor.
This function is especially useful for tournaments with limited entry
space; if you pre-registered a bunch of TBA entries ahead of time, you
can use this function to transfer that TBA slot to the signed up
competitor. Confirm by hitting the blue arrow-transfer icon.

You can also use the blue checkmark icon to simply accept the signup and
register them into the tournament at that time. And finally you can use
the red X to reject the signup slot.

Once you have accepted or rejected entries, they will show up as normal
under your Entries and Competitors tab, appear on your tournament
invoice, and trigger judging obligations like usual. They will also show
their entry status on the approvals page:

<figure>
<img src="approval-page-step2.png"
title="File:approval-page-step2.png" />
<figcaption><a
href="File:approval-page-step2.png">File:approval-page-step2.png</a></figcaption>
</figure>

None of the actions you take on this screen will trigger an automatic
notice to either the parents or students themselves; therefore if you
click the wrong button you can undo it later. The only thing you cannot
undo is transferring a slot to the wrong student; if you do that you
have to either drop the entry under the Entries tab or transfer the slot
to another student.

## Tournament Emails & Notifications

Since the system does not automatically notify, we also created a new
Emails tab for a school registration at a tournament. You can use this
tab to send emails to all the linked students, all the linked judges,
parents following students, or all three at a tournament at any time.
You can also use this page to download and print a contact list of all
the students, judges, etc at your tournament:
