You can use any email address you like to sign up. If you put in your
cell phone number and choose your provider, you will be able to receive
texts from tournaments you attend with pairings, information, etc.

You can edit your contact information as well as opt out of text or
notification emails in your [account settings](Your_Account "wikilink")
after signing up.

Once you have signed up, you will be given a number of options to get
started, whether you're a coach, a student, or a tournament director:

After signing up you will have to verify your account by entering a
confirmation code. If you think that you did not receive a confirmation
code please be sure to check your spam folder. If the code was never
sent, please contact help@tabroom.com. Tabroom support staff can
manually confirm and verify your account.
