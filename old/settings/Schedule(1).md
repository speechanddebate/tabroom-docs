A timeslot is a block of time that you will schedule rounds into.
Different events can share one timeslot."

**Label** - Name for round. For example "LD Round 1"

**Day** - What tournament day the round will occur.

**Start Time** - Start time for the round that will display on the
pairings.

**End Time** - End time for the round that will impact when another
round can be scheduled (the system avoids overlaps).

**Rnd** - Option to assign that timeslot to a given event.

**Label** - Label that will appear in the Schematics screen.

**Type** - The options for "Type" are as follows:

- "Prelim/Preset" - Round will be pre-paired before the start of the
  tournament, either randomly or using a set of tournament-entered
  seeds. For more information on entering prelim seeds, see the section
  on Pairing Rounds.

<!-- -->

- "Hi/Lo" - Round will be power-matched by pairing the highest seed in a
  bracket (based on your chosen tiebreak set) against the lowest seed in
  the bracket. This is the most commonly used method of powermatching in
  prelim rounds.

<!-- -->

- "Hi/Hi" - Round will be power-matched by pairing the highest seed in a
  bracket (based on your chosen tiebreak set) against the second seed in
  the bracket. The third seed will be paired against the fourth seed,
  and so on. Hi/Hi rounds are usually reserved for only 1 odd-numbered
  prelim (such as round 5 of 8), and are used to reduce the number of
  teams with few or no losses. At many tournaments, this is unnecessary.
  If in doubt about the desirability of a Hi/Hi round for your
  circumstances, go with a Hi/Lo instead.

<!-- -->

- "Elim" - Round is an elimination round. Make sure you also choose the
  correct tiebreaker set for the elims.

<!-- -->

- "Final" - Should be used for the final round in each event.

**Tiebreaker** - The options for "Tiebreaks" will be any tiebreak rule
sets you have configured. Make sure to set the tiebreak set to your
"elim" tiebreakers for each of your elim rounds. For more information on
configuring these, see the section on Rules & Results.

**Flights** - Option to mark how many flights you would like the round
to occur. Usually 1 or 2.

**Move** - This dropdown will list the other open timeslots. Selecting a
timeslot from this dropdown will move your label, round type, and
tiebreaker to the new timeslot.
