<img src="/screenshots/tabs_settings_money.png" title="tabs_settings_money.png" /> The Money menu is
where you set entry, school, and judge fees, as well as nuisance fines.
You can also configure "concessions," which are any item you want to
sell, such as parking passes. Note that it is also possible to set some
of these amounts in the Judge Group and Event settings - if the same
value can be set in two places, changing it in one will automatically
update the other.

The different types of fees and fines can be configured by first
choosing an option from the sidebar:

## Entry Fees

The Entry Fees link aggregates the entry fees set for all events, and
lets you view or edit them in one place:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_entry.png" title="setup_money_entry.png"
width="500" alt="setup_money_entry.png" />

You also have options for whether to include waitlisted entries in a
school's invoice, and whether they should count towards judge
obligations (which might trigger fines if a school is under their
commitment).

Note that entry fees are calculated per "entry," not per student - so
for example a 2-person policy team would count as a single "entry." If
you want to set a "per person" fee instead (or in addition), use the
School & Student Fees section instead.

## School & Student Fees

To set a fee for each student from a school, fill out a value for "Fee
for each individual student." Alternately, you can set a fee for each
individual "person," which will include judges as well, and will ask
registrants how many non-judging coaches should also be included.

title="setup_money_schools-overall.png" width="500" />

Note that "per-student" and "per-person" fees are levied in **addition**
to any per-event entry fee which that student incurs.

You can also add a "Per-School" Fee - these can be set for any purposes
you choose by filling out a description, fee, and optionally a date on
which the fee should apply:

title="setup_money_schools-perschool.png" width="500" />

Lastly, you can choose to apply a "universal" fee that will be applied
to all registered schools. Note that once you apply a universal fee, the
only way to get rid of it is to manually edit every school's invoice -
so be 100% sure you want to apply the fee before doing so:

## Judge Hire Fees

The Judge Hire Fees link is where you can set fees both for hired
judging as well as how much to charge a team under their judging
commitment, regardless of whether the tournament provides hired judging.

Before you can set judging fees, make sure you have entered an
"abbreviation" for each judge group (**Settings - Judges - Judge Group -
Register**), otherwise you won't be able to tell which judge group
you're assigning fees for.

The first section lets you assign different types of fees for each judge
group:
<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_hires-fees.png" title="setup_money_hires-fees.png"
width="500" alt="setup_money_hires-fees.png" />

**Per hire** charges for each approved hired judge request by the
school. Each accepted hire request charges this much and count as a full
judge towards a school's obligation.

**Per uncovered entry** charges for each entry covered by an approved
hire request; schools can hire out "partial judges" rather than having
to buy a whole judge to cover less than an entire judge's worth of
entries.

**Per missing judge** charges a flat fee for every judge the school is
missing. This will be charged automatically. Approved hire requests will
not count towards this fee.

You can also set the number of judges available to hire in each judge
group:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_hires-availability.png"
title="setup_money_hires-availability.png" width="500" />

If you set a number here, Tabroom will automatically accept judge hire
requests until that amount of judging is sold. If you instead want to
manually approve all judge hire requests, you should set this number to
zero.

## Nuisance Fines

When set, nuisance fines are levied automatically when a school or judge
does something annoying, such as late registrations, late entry drops,
or missing an assigned round. You can choose a dollar amount for each of
these:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_fines.png" title="setup_money_fines.png"
width="500" />

You also have the option of whether to automatically email a school's
coach when a fine is applied. This can be useful when, for example, a
judge misses a round and a coach can track them down and yell at them so
they don't miss future rounds as well.

You can change the deadline after which some of the nuisance fines apply
in **Settings - Tournament - Dates & Deadlines.**

## Concessions

A "concession" is any item that you want to sell at the tournament, such
as parking passes or bus tickets. These will then be available for
purchase when a school registers on the website, and they will be
charged on their school invoice (or separately).

To add a new concession, just add a name, price, and description. If
desired, you can also add a cap, which will limit the total number that
can be sold (for example if you only have a limited number of parking
passes). You can also set an order deadline for items that need to be
purchased by a particular date.

<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_concessions.png"
title="setup_money_concessions.png" width="500" />

On the sidebar, you can also configure how concessions appear to
registering schools:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_money_concessions-settings.png"
title="setup_money_concessions-settings.png" width="300" />

If the word "concessions" is likely to be confusing, you can change the
tab on your tournament's website to say something more descriptive, like
"Parking."

You also have a choice of whether concession fees are included in the
school's main invoice (along with the rest of their fees), or billed on
a separate page.
