The "Reports" menu option is where you generate printouts for any kind
of result set you need, including lists of entries, speaker awards, and
sweepstakes for an awards ceremony.

Results reports are available by Event, School, or Entry. For any
report, select the event(s) and/or round(s) to include in the report,
and then click "Print." For some reports, you can also choose to limit
the resulting list to only a certain number, such as the top 20.
