Tabroom keeps a log of most of the changes you make to your tournament
as they happen, such as entry drops or pairing a round. The "Change Log"
menu option lets you view these logs, which can make it easier to track
down when something happened or who made a particular change.

First, you should set a date range on the sidebar - it's usually helpful
to include a little extra on each side of your range, just in case you
were wrong about the time.

Then, choose which log you want to view, including Entry/Judge drops or
moves, or the full tabulation log.
