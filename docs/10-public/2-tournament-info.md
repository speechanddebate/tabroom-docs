Each tournament hosted on Tabroom has its own set of public pages,
which you can use to view the invitation, entries, judges, pairings,
etc.

First, you must access the tournament you're interested in. This is
usually done by clicking the name of the tournament from one of the
[calendars](calendars), whether the main calendar on the
homepage, a circuit-specific calendar, or your personalized calendar of
upcoming tournaments visible when you first log in to your account.

If you are accessing the tournament from your "Upcoming Tournaments"
list, you can also click the "Register" button next to a tournament to
jump straight to your school's registration.

After clicking on a tournament, you will be taken to the main
information page for that tournament:

You will see a series of tabs with information about the tournament:

width="500" />

You can get information on each of these tabs below.

## Invite

The Invite tab will frequently have information about the tournament,
dates and deadlines, hotel info, etc. If the tournament director has not
pasted that information in, you should also look in the sidebar to see
if there is a downloadable invitation:

## Entries

The Entries tab will let you see all current entries in the tournament,
including information about a waitlist, if applicable. First, select the
event you're interested in on the right, and you will see the list of
entries:

## Judges

The Judges tab has the list of judges entered for each event. You can
also click the "Event Paradigms" link on the right for a page with all
the paradigms for that event combined in one place, or use the "PDF"
link to get the same thing in a downloadable/printable format:

## Pairings

The Pairings tab contains both live pairings for the tournament, as well
as important judge information. First, select the event you're
interested in on the right, and then select a round from the list. You
will be taken to a pairing:

### Entry Info

complete record at that tournament, where you can also sign up for [live
updates](live-updates) for that team:

### Judge Info

From the Pairings tab, there is a list of Judges for each event, and
depending on the tournament, may be links for a list of judges obligated
in the next debate:

Clicking on a judge will take you to their judge record for the

directly from the pairing. From this page, you can see how they've
voted, along with links to their full judging record and the option to
