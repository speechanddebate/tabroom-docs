Determining How Many Rooms to Purchase

For each day of your tournament, determine the maximum number of rounds
you will run simultaneously—that number is the number of rooms you
should purchase. This is equivalent to an in-person tournament—you will
need the same number of NSDA Campus rooms per day you would need to hold
those same rounds in person per day. Example: If you will have 30 rounds
happening at the same time on Friday, then 25 on Saturday, and 10 on
Sunday, you'll need to purchase 65 rooms. Flighted rounds are possible
in NSDA Campus and do not require separate rooms. Determine the number
of rooms based upon how many rooms are running simultaneously in a time
slot, not how many "rounds" are happening in a room. If you need to run
more than 150 rooms simultaneously, please contact us before buying so
that we can provide you with more information about running a tournament
of that size.
