In order to view personalized results, you must first "link" your
Tabroom account to your school's competitor or judge entry. See the
section on [your account](/your-account) for instructions on
how to link your account.

## Student Results

If your account is linked to a student entry, your account dashboard
(click your username/email at the top) will have a list of recent
results. You can also click the link for "Past Pairings and Results" to
view the list:

alt="user_student_index-past.png" />
<img src="/screenshots/user_student_index.png" title="user_student_index.png"
width="400" alt="user_student_index.png" />

Just click the "Record" link next to the tournament you're interested in
to see your results from that tournament.

If there are any RFD's or Comments are available, they will be listed on
the right for each round:

### NDT Bid Sheets

If you are a college NDT/CEDA debater, you can add honors (such as
speaker awards) to your results that will appear as part of your NDT bid
sheet. Below your list of recent results, find the section for "Honors":
