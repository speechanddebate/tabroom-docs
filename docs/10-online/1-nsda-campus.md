This software is intended for Live/Synchronous Competition. Asynchronous
speech rounds using one recording for the duration of the tournament is
a FREE feature offered through Tabroom.com.

## Determining How Many Rooms to Purchase

For each day of your tournament, determine the maximum number of rounds
you will run simultaneously—that number is the number of rooms you
should purchase. This is equivalent to an in-person tournament—you will
need the same number of NSDA Campus rooms per day you would need to hold
those same rounds in person per day.

- Example: If you will have 30 rounds happening at the same time on
  Friday, then 25 on Saturday, and 10 on Sunday, you'll need to purchase
  65 rooms.
- Flighted rounds are possible in NSDA Campus and do not require
  separate rooms. Determine the number of rooms based upon how many
  rooms are running simultaneously in a time slot, not how many "rounds"
  are happening in a room.

## Purchasing NSDA Campus Rooms

Although one does not need to be an NSDA Member to purchase NSDA Campus
rooms, they must have a free speechanddebate.org website account to
complete the purchase. For a quicker purchasing process, be sure to be
signed into your speechanddebate.org account before requesting rooms in
Tabroom.com.

After creating a tournament and making decisions regarding entries,
schedules, and fees, etc., tournament directors can purchase rooms in
NSDA Campus. Under the Settings tab, select Tournament, then navigate to
the Payment tab.

Add the total number of rooms needed for the tournament (each "room" is
good for a 24-hour period beginning at 6:00 a.m in your local time
zone). After filling in the quantity, click the button next to it that
says "request". That will load a purchase form with the important
details filled in and allow you to complete checkout.

You must divide and assign the rooms as needed in the tournament setup
after purchase by clicking "Setup Campus Day Allocations" on the right
side of the screen at Settings \> Tournament \> Payment.

Remember—rooms will not be activated until payment is received. The
tournament must be created and paid for (a Purchase Order counts as
payment) at least 30 minutes before the tournament starts. Rooms can be
added after the original purchase at any time at least 30 minutes before
the tournament begins. There are no exceptions to the policy and no
refunds or credits available for unused rooms.

## Configuring an Event as Online via NSDA Campus

[Once an event has been created](events) an online tab will
appear.

<img src="/screenshots/V1.png" title="V1.png" width="550" />

Use the Online Event toggle to set the event to green (online)

<img src="/screenshots/V2.png" title="V2.png" width="300" />

Select NSDA Campus by clicking on the circle to the right of the text.

<img src="/screenshots/V3.png" title="V3.png" width="400" />

Make the appropriate selections under Identify Users in Online Rooms.
This gives you the option to set how each user's name is displayed in
the video room. For example, Tab - George Brown, Judge - Alana Green, or
Code - Student Name. Select the option that works best for your
tournament.

<img src="/screenshots/V4.png" title="V4.png" width="400" />

The section titled Online Support Options gives tabulation staff the
ability to list email(s) and instructions that will appear on online
room landing pages.

<img src="/screenshots/V5.png" title="V5.png" width="650" />

## Setting up Competition Rooms

Once your tournament's rooms are activated, you can designate rooms for
each day of the tournament. All settings are accessed by hovering over
the Settings tab, clicking on Sites & Rooms, then selecting NSDA Campus
in the upper right corner.

<img src="/screenshots/Day_Allocation.png" title="Day_Allocation.png" width="700" />

## Setting up Utility Rooms (e.g., Judge Pooling, Tab Rooms, etc.)

After purchasing NSDA Campus rooms, hover over the Paneling tab and
click on Rooms.

<img src="/screenshots/A1.png" title="A1.png" width="200" />

Select Utility and add a room name.

<img src="/screenshots/A2.png" title="A2.png" width="400" />

Determine if this room is for Entries, Judges, Coaches, or Tab, and
whether it's for a specific event, and click Save.

<img src="/screenshots/A4.png" title="A4.png" width="200" />

Remember—we suggest that rooms host no more than 15 people at a time. If
you need a room that can easily manage more than 15 people, you may want
to set up a room on a different platform (e.g., Zoom) for better
quality.

To set up a utility room using an external platform like Zoom, follow
the instructions above and change the dropdown from "NSDA Campus" to
"External Service" next to the utility room in question. Then, paste a
link to the external room and save.

If you plan to have a large group spanning multiple events to meet in
one external room, create a separate utility room for each judge
category and paste the same link for each utility room. For example, if
you want all PF, LD, and CX judges to meet in one Judge Pooling room in
Zoom, create a Judge Pooling room for PF judges, a separate Judge
Pooling room for LD judges, and a separate Judge Pooling room for CX
judges. Change all the dropdowns from "NSDA Campus" to "External
Service" and paste the same Zoom link for all three of the utility
rooms.

Remember- utility/squad rooms will not "show up" for users until the
start time of your tournament. If you'd like to use them for
registration or pre-tournament gatherings you must change/set your
tournament start time to the time you'd like them to be available.

## Purchasing NSDA Campus Rooms

NSDA Campus rooms can also be purchased from Settings \> Tournament \>
Payments. Like last year, each NSDA Campus room covers one room for one
day of use. If your tournament lasts multiple days, you will purchase
sets of rooms for each day.

Tabroom.com will help you estimate the number of NSDA Campus rooms
needed for one day of preliminary rounds. For debate, it will take into
account whether you are flighting rounds, and for speech and Congress,
it will divide your entry numbers by the default section size in your
event settings. For the best estimate, make sure your entry numbers are
final and your settings are complete! Make sure you double check the
estimates with your own calculations.

width="500" />

When you are ready to purchase your NSDA Campus rooms, enter the number
of rooms you wish to purchase and follow the payment instructions
described above. Once payment is complete, don't forget to allocate your
purchased rooms to days at Settings \> Tournament \> Payment.

### New: NSDA Campus with Observers

Based on your feedback, we are now testing a new type of NSDA Campus
room that permits a limited number of coach observers to join the room
during a round. For \$14 per room per day, a tournament director can
purchase rooms that allow coaches to designate observers on a per-round
and per-entry basis. An event or division using Campus with Observers
must do so for the entirety of the tournament; it is not possible to
purchase normal NSDA Campus rooms for one day and Campus with Observer
rooms for a different day.

Due to technical limits on the number of participants in Campus rooms,
Campus with Observers is limited to 2 observers per entry in debate
events or 1 observer per entry in speech events. In order to preserve
the quality of competition, Campus with Observers cannot work with
Congress. Campus with Observers is intended to be a way for coaches to
observe their students in round; to allow non-coaches or large audiences
to view rounds, please consider live streaming!

If your students are competing in an event using Campus with Observers
rooms, you can designate observers from the tournament dashboard. Only
Tabroom.com accounts with Coach/Administrator access to your school in
Tabroom.com (which can be designated on the Access tab) may be
designated as observers.

<img src="/screenshots/campus_payment_shot_8.png" title="campus_payment_shot_8.png"
width="500" />

Coaches may designate observers on their school tournament dashboard on
a per-entry basis. Those observers can then enter rooms from the
tournament dashboard. Coaches can change observers at any time during a
tournament. However, once one observer in speech or two in debate enters
a room, no other coaches can enter that room for your entry, even if
observer permissions are changed on the dashboard or if they leave the
room.

## Linking Student Performance Videos

Note: NSDA Campus does not provide a means for recording or storing
videos, but it does allow tournaments to upload links to videos recorded
elsewhere.
\# Once your tournament is created, hover over the Entries tab and then
click Data.

1.  Click the blue rectangle with the words Import CSV/Excel.
2.  Upload a CSV file that has columns for Code and Link. Detailed

## Holding Asynchronous Prelims and Synchronous Elims

For prelims, hover over Settings, then click on Events.
<img src="/screenshots/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_12.27.34_PM.png"
title="Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_12.27.34_PM.png" width="200"
alt="Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_12.27.34_PM.png" />

Select the event you wish to edit.
<img src="/screenshots/B4.png" title="B4.png" width="400" alt="B4.png" />

Click the Online tab, then set the event to "Asynchronous links to
online videos."
<img src="/screenshots/B1.png" title="B1.png" width="600" alt="B1.png" />

Upload your video links.

Once prelims are over, go back to Settings » Events » Event » Online,
and set to "NSDA Campus."

At this point, your rounds will be synchronous and will have links to
NSDA Campus rooms.

Remember—The NSDA Campus rooms have to be purchased in advance and
assigned to the correct day of your tournament. [Detailed Instructions

## Live Streaming Options

NSDA campus offers the ability to livestream elimination rounds. To
enable this function:

First access the tournament and click settings. Then events, the
specific event, and finally the online tab.

You should then see the button for enabling livestreams.
<img src="/screenshots/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_1.21.31_PM.png"
title="Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_1.21.31_PM.png" width="550"
alt="Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_1.21.31_PM.png" />

- You can also livestream by using the free Open Broadcaster Software
  (OBS):

[https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/)
\* OBS allows anyone to stream what they see on their screen (including
an NSDA Campus room) directly to YouTube or other streaming services.

- For tournaments considering streaming via YouTube, please remember
  that YouTube requires the streamer to have a verified YouTube
  streaming account, which takes approximately 24 hours and must be set
  up before the day of the tournament.
- You may also opt to use a different video platform (e.g., Zoom) for
  your later elimination rounds that you wish to stream. You can then
  save a URL to a specific external room in Settings » Sites & Rooms to
  be used on a Tabroom.com pairing.
- You also have the option to host your elimination rounds on a public
  server that has the ability to livestream to YouTube enabled directly
  from NSDA Campus. However, this comes with significant downsides and
  is entirely at your own risk:


\* Security – While issues are unlikely, these public rooms are much
less secure and susceptible to unauthorized access.

- Quality – Additional observers in public rooms will degrade the
  audio/video quality, potentially significantly.
- Stability – Since the public rooms are not under the NSDA's control,
  we can't guarantee their stability or performance.

## Tips for Successful Setup on NSDA Campus

As you're planning your tournament, past tournament hosts have
discovered that these suggestions have made their tournaments run more
smoothly on the NSDA Campus platform!
We will continue to add tips as they are shared with NSDA Staff.
Ensure all participants are linked on Tabroom in advance. For more
information about linking accounts,[please review this
video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YNrHUweRPA)

- **Stagger start times** - It works best to stagger round blasts/start
  times for different events by at least 5 minutes. This helps with
  server load, so that everyone at the tournament isn't joining their
  room at the exact same time. Additionally, users will not be able to
  access rooms/rounds until after the time your tournament "starts."
  Consider setting your tournament start time as an hour before your
  rounds are scheduled.
- **Less "in room" wait time** - The less time users are in rooms the
  better! No need for users to be in rooms for thirty minutes to an hour
  before start time!
- **Back up Plan** - Some users may not be able to access NSDA Campus
  rooms for reasons neither you nor the NSDA can control (such as school
  content filters). Have a backup plan for rooms outside of the NSDA
  Campus platform for those unique situations. Consider using Zoom,
  Google Meets, or other virtual platforms.
- **Understand the NSDA's Backup Procedures** - In the event of a
  widespread technical issue, the NSDA has multiple backup plans to
  switch infrastructure and ensure Campus will continue to operate. In
  that case, the best thing to do is have your participants close their
  rooms, wait 5-10 minutes, and come back in via Tabroom/Speechwire.
  There usually will be no need to postpone rounds more than that,
  repair, or take other drastic action unless told otherwise by the
  NSDA.

## How do Flighted Rounds work?

- Each flight will have its own unique NSDA Campus Room and Link - BUT
  this does not mean you need to purchase additional rooms. Purchase the
  number of rooms you would need if you were hosting "in-person" because
  that is the number of rounds you are running simultaneously.

For example, if an LD division has 60 entries and will be flighted, you
need a minimum of 15 rooms.

- Between flights, judges will need to leave one NSDA Campus room and
  join another.

## What do we need to do to ensure we can access NSDA Campus from school?

Direct all users to first test both the competition space and the
practice space here by going to https://campus.speechanddebate.org/
Here are the websites you'll want to make sure you've whitelisted:

- \*.jitsi.net
- meet.jit.si
- web-cdn.jitsi.net
- meet-east.speechanddebate.org
- meet-west.speechanddebate.org
- meet.speechanddebate.org
- campus.speechanddebate.org

## What happens if something goes wrong?

First, don't panic! The NSDA has multiple backup plans, and can almost
always get things back on track in a short timeframe. In the event of
major issues, we can also move participants over to backup servers,
either piecemeal or all at once, as the situation requires. Each of
these steps only takes a few minutes, so stay patient. Unless you hear
otherwise from NSDA Staff, there's no need to move all rooms to a
different platform, redo round pairings, or postpone your schedule. Most
glitches can be dealt with by a short 5-10 minute pause: have everyone
leave their rooms, wait a few minutes for us to fix the problem, then
try to re-enter their room via Tabroom/Speechwire. Repeatedly reloading
the page will just make things worse. Once the NSDA has remedied the
source of the problem, rooms should go back to working again as
normal.

If you experience problems, attempt to determine whether the issue is
actually with NSDA Campus, or with individual participants. If you're
only getting reports of issues from some participants, the issue is very
unlikely to be with Campus itself. If every room simultaneously starts
having issues (e.g. mass disconnections or "kick outs"), it is more
likely to be a Campus-wide issue.

We now have a centralized status dashboard for all NSDA Services: [NSDA
STATUS](https://status.speechanddebate.org)

In the event of any glitches or downtime with Campus or Tabroom (or
other NSDA services), this site will be kept up to date with the issue,
the planned fix, and any expected time for resolution. We strongly
suggest you check this site first before emailing or calling the NSDA
office - it will be the fastest way to get info out to everyone. We'll
communicate any info we have via the site, and you can direct your
participants there as well to get the all clear.

If you have any additional questions, please email
**info@speechanddebate.org**.
