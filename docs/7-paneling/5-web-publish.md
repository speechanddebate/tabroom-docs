This screen allows you to publish results for an event. You may choose
to publish ballots, speaker points, or feedback per round per event or
mass publish all ballots for events once the tournament has concluded.
The options to do so are to not publish at all, publish to only coaches,
publish to coaches and competitors, and publish to the public.
