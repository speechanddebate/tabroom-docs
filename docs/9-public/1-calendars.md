Clicking the name of any tournament will take you to that tournaments
information page, where you can view the invitation, contact info, etc.
Clicking the name of a circuit in the tournament list will take you to a
sub-calendar showing just tournaments from that circuit.

Or, you can filter the list of tournaments by date, country, or state
using the tools on the right.

## Circuit Calendars

On Tabroom, a "Circuit" is a collection of related tournaments, for
example from a specific league or state. All tournaments must belong to
at least one circuit. Each Circuit has it's own sub-calendar.

From the home page, click the "Circuits" tab:
