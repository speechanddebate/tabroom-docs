title: "Prefs"

This section of the manual explains how to access and complete a judge
preference sheet ("pref sheet") for a tournament which uses mutually
preferred judging.

If the tournament you are attending uses MPJ, you will see a "Prefs" tab
while viewing your entry (once prefs are opened by the tournament):

## Accessing Prefs as a Coach

As a coach, you can access the prefs for all of your entries by going to
the Prefs tab, which will appear in red if you have any incomplete pref
sheets. If necessary, select the relevant Judge Group from the menu on
the sidebar, then, select the pref sheet you want to edit:

## Accessing Prefs as a Competitor

In order for you to access your own pref sheet as a competitor, your
coach must have first checked the box for "Entries may enter their own
prefs" in your School settings.

If they have done so, you will see a list of tournaments with pref
sheets in the "Upcoming" section of the sidebar, and then you can select
the link for the pref sheet you want to edit:

## Filling Out Prefs

The interface for filling out your pref sheet will differ slightly
depending on whether the tournament uses tiers or ordinal prefs.

For example, if using tiers, you will select a tier for each judge. Note
that "C" is a Constraint, and "S" is a Strike. You can also click the
button to export your current pref sheet to a spreadsheet for future
reference:

If using tiers, the sidebar will show you how many judges you currently
have in each tier, and whether you have the correct number of judges in
each:

If using ordinals, you can either give each judge a number (you can use
the "Fill Gaps" button at the bottom to help deal with accidental gaps):

Or, you can switch to the "Drag and Drop" mode, and move judges up and
down in the order:

To switch back to the previous mode, you can click the button for
"Numeric Entry."

When done, make sure to press "Save Prefs" at the bottom.

## Duplicating Prefs

![](/screenshots/user_enter_ratings_dolly.png "user_enter_ratings_dolly.png") If you
want to copy prefs from one entry to another, you can use the "Dolly the
Sheep" section of the sidebar. This will let you export your pref sheet
to a spreadsheet, automatically fill in the sheet based on previous
prefs (if using ordinals), copy prefs from another entry, or copy the
current sheet over another entry's prefs.

**Important Note** - Make sure to be careful when copying prefs between
one sheet and another - once you confirm the copy, there's no "undo"
button.
