<img src="/screenshots/tabs_settings_tournament.png" title="tabs_settings_tournament.png" /> The
first menu option is for "Tournament" settings, and gives you a large
number of general options related to your tournament. Many of these were
set when you first requested the tournament, but can be changed here if
necessary.

## Name & Info

The Name & Info tab lets you set your tournaments name, location, and
webname:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_main.png" title="setup_tourn_main.png" />

**Tournament Full Name** - This is the name which will appear on
tournament calendars and in things like result packets.

**Tournament Web name** - This is the name for your tournaments website,
which comes in the form webname.tabroom.com - visitors to that web
address will be taken directly to your [Tournament
Info](/tournament-info) page on Tabroom, where they can view
your invitation, postings, results, etc. Don't use the year (like 2015)
in your Web Name, as tournaments can reuse the same webname for multiple
years.

**Time Zone** - The timezone for your tournament controls things like
your registration deadlines, drop fee deadlines, etc.

**Location Country/State** - This will control where your tournament is
listed on various Tabroom [Calendars](/calendars).

Also on this tab are options for adding your tournament to other
circuits (pending approval):

title="setup_tourn_main-circuits.png" width="600" />

You can also upload an image for your tournament logo here. Invitation
or Congress Packet uploads have moved to 'Settings: Website.'

## Settings

The Settings tab of the Tournament settings controls a number of
tournament-wide options, mostly related to registration:

### General Settings

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_settings-general.png"
title="setup_tourn_settings-general.png" width="600" />

**Require adult contact info to register** - This will allow people
registering for your tournament to provide an adult's contact
information before proceeding with their registration. This is useful to
ensure that you can get in touch with someone responsible, especially if
competitors are allowed to attend your tournament unsupervised.

**Tabroom account based coaches & contacts** - This will allow only
those with Tabroom.com accounts to be added to and compete in your
tournament.

**Log registration changes** - This will keep a log on Tabroom
(accessible in **Entries - Change Log**) of changes made to
registration, including adds and drops.

**Hide Speaker Codes from Registrants** - Normally, schools who have
registered will be able to see their speaker codes in advance of the
tournament. This option is used for tournaments which want to be more
opaque about the postings.

**Closed tournament: admin staff registers** - This option will disable
all online registration. Entries and Judges will instead need to be
entered manually from the Entries menu.

**Test tournament, not public** - A "Test" tournament will not appear on
any of the Tabroom calendars, and will enable features that allow you to
quickly generate "fake" entries, judges, and results. This can be useful
when experimenting with Tabroom, but should never be enabled for a real
tournament.

**Publish list of registered schools** - When enabled, a list of
registered schools will be available on your tournaments public info
pages. This is usually safe to enable.

**Use school regions** - Use this option for tournaments where you plan
to divide schools into "regions," for example to preset a few rounds
where schools from the same region can't debate. This will enable
additional options for setting up regions in **Entries - Data.** For
this option to be useful, you'll also need to check the box in the
[Events](/events) settings to "Avoid in-region matchups in
presets."

**Tournament-wide cap on entries** - This sets a maximum cap on the
number of entries allowed at the tournament across all events and
divisions. You can also set per-event caps in the
[Events](/events) settings, which is frequently more useful.

**School code style** - Determines how school codes are assigned, which
appear on pairings, etc. The default is to shorten the school name.

**First school code** - Only useful when using the "Incremental" school
code style (AA, AB, AC, etc.). Lets you determine a "starting" code that
will then be incremented, so you can start with a code like ZZA, and
then it would increment to ZZB, ZZC, etc.

### On-Site Registration

This tab is also where you configure options for "On-Site" online
registration. This is designed to allow schools to "check in" online,
when they arrive at the tournament site, instead of physically coming to
registration.

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_settings-onsite.png"
title="setup_tourn_settings-onsite.png" width="600" />

To use "on-site" registration, toggle the button to enable it, and then
set a date and time when on-site registration starts and end - it will
open and close automatically based on the dates you set. This should be
after normal online registration has closed. You can also decide whether
to limit the ability to check-in online to schools which have paid their
registration fees. If you have a "Registration Packet," (e.g. maps,
directions, etc.) you can upload it here and it will be made available
for download to schools as they check in.

### Clone Settings

To speed up tournament setup, you can duplicate tournament settings from
a previous year. This function will import general tournament settings,
judge groups, events, schedule, etc. It will NOT import entries, judges,
or previous results. This option should only be used once, before you
have made any other changes to the tournament setup. If you have already
created Judge Groups or Events, you will end up with duplicates. To use,
just select the prior year from the dropdown box and click "Clone."

### Site Admin Only Options

You almost definitely should ignore these - they are only applicable if
you are running particular Nationals (like NSDA Nationals, NCFL, etc),
or need to require specific NSDA District requirements for your
tournament.

## Dates

The Dates tab is where you control various dates and times like
registration deadlines, tournament start times, drop fee deadlines, etc.
Most of them were set automatically when you created the tournament, but
if you need to change them (for example to extend registration by a few
hours), this is where you can change them.

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_dates.png" title="setup_tourn_dates.png"
width="600" />

## Access

The Access tab is where you control which Tabroom accounts have
administrative access to your tournament. You can have as many
tournament staff with access to the tournament as you want. You will see
a list of people with access:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_access.png" title="setup_tourn_access.png"
width="600" />

For each person, you can choose whether they are a contact for the
tournament and if they should have full access to the tournament setup.
If you have tournament staff who only need to be able to check rooms,
such as getting rounds started, but don't want them to have full
administrative access to the tournament, you can select 'Checker' to the
right rather than 'Tabber' or 'Owner.' If you have tournament staff who
only need to have access to one event rather than the full tournament,
you can select specific events on the right for that purpose.

To completely revoke someone's access, click the "trash can" button next
to their name.

To add a new account, use the box on the sidebar:

<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_access-add.png" title="setup_tourn_access-add.png"
width="300" />

## Messages

The Messages tab lets you include information that will appear on
invoices (such as a mailing address for checks, or other pertinent
payment info), as well as a disclaimer that will appear before allowing
schools to register (such as a policy regarding student supervision):
<img src="/screenshots/setup_tourn_messages.png" title="setup_tourn_messages.png"
width="500" alt="setup_tourn_messages.png" />

## Notes

The Notes tab is just a scratchpad for you to keep track of ideas or
problems that arise during the tournament, like reminders of how to do
something on Tabroom, or thoughts on which restaurant to use for
catering, or which competition rooms turned out to be too small. These
notes will then be preserved in future years if you use the Clone
Tournament function when setting up the tournament.

## Payment

The Payment tab allows you to pay for the use of Tabroom during your
tournament based on entry numbers and/or to pay for the use of NSDA
Campus rooms if your tournament is being held online.
