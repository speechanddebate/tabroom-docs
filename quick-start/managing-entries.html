view and manipulate entry information, whether
you are using online registration or entering data manually. It&#x27;s also
where you go to import or export data when using other tab programs,
such as TRPC, or to see a variety of statistics about your tournament.
Also included are functions for dealing with invoices and communicating
with registrants.</p>
<p>Via the Entries menu, you can access information about any individual
entry, judge, or school. Note that most information pages link to one

<p>Usually, the fastest way to find information in Tabroom is to use the
search box in the upper right corner of the page.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/tabs_search.png" title="tabs_search.png" width="200">
<p>For example, if you search for a school&#x27;s name, you&#x27;ll be taken right to
their entry. If you search for a judge&#x27;s or entry&#x27;s last name, you&#x27;ll be
taken straight to their info page. If there are multiple items that
match your search, you&#x27;ll be given a list of results.</p>
<p>You can quickly set the focus to the search box by using Ctrl+S on your
keyboard. Then, just type your search and press Enter.</p>

<p>Each school registered for your tournament has it&#x27;s own page where you
can see their entries, judges, vital information, and invoices, as well
as mark them as &quot;registered&quot; when they arrive at the tournament. You can
access these with the &quot;Schools&quot; menu option.</p>
<p>A few other school related options, such as adding a new school or
viewing school statistics are instead found under the &quot;Data&quot; or
&quot;Reports&quot; menu options and will be mentioned below.</p>

<p>To access a school&#x27;s page, you select it from one of the dropdown menus
under the Schools menu option:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_index-schools.png" title="register_index-schools.png" width="300">
<p>School&#x27;s will be listed as &quot;Not Checked In&quot; until they are marked as

school (if using &quot;On-Site&quot; registration - see the section on <a href="/settings/tournament">General
Settings</a> for more info). Once they are
registered at the tournament, they will be in the &quot;Checked In&quot; menu
instead.</p>
<p>The Judges and Money tabs will appear in red if a school is under their
judging obligations, or if they owe judge fees:</p>

you use the &quot;Data&quot; menu option, and then click &quot;Add new school&quot; on the
sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_data_index-entry.png" title="register_data_index-entry.png" width="300">
<p>If your tournament is listed in a circuit, you&#x27;ll have the option of
adding a school in the same circuit. Otherwise, you can manually add a
school by name. If Tabroom finds a matching school with a similar name,
you&#x27;ll be prompted whether to add the pre-existing school or create one
from scratch:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_data_add-school.png" title="register_data_add-school.png" width="500">
<p>The same section of the sidebar also has options to check on &quot;Empty
schools&quot; which have zero entries, and then delete them all en-masse.
This can be useful to clean up your tournament data if you have a lot of
schools that clicked on your tournament (creating an &quot;entry&quot;), who never
actually entered students. There are similar functions for dropping or
deleting &quot;TBA&quot; entries from all schools.</p>

<p>The &quot;Money&quot; tab of a school page is where you go to view a school&#x27;s
invoice, add and remove fees/fines, and record a school&#x27;s payment.</p>
<p>The Money tab contains an itemized school invoice with all entry fees,
judging fees, purchased concessions, and nuisance fines all in one
place. It will update automatically as changes are made to a school&#x27;s
entry (for example dropping a team before the add/drop deadline).</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_school_invoice-fees.png" title="register_school_invoice-fees.png" width="500">
<p>Fees or Nuisance Fines can be removed from a school&#x27;s invoice by

deletion, no record of that charge will remain on the invoice.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/Custom_Invoice_Image.png" title="Custom_Invoice_Image.png" width="300">
<p>To add additional charges or payments, use the &quot;Add Charge&quot; box on the

Amount.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_school_invoice-add.png" title="register_school_invoice-add.png" width="300">
<p>If you need a printout of the invoice, for example to hand out at

generate a PDF using the pdf icon on the invoice:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_school_invoice-printouts.png" title="register_school_invoice-printouts.png" width="500">
<p>If you have configured concessions available for purchase, you will also
see a separate tab for &quot;Concessions,&quot; or &quot;Label You Create&quot; which will
let you add or remove concessions orders for a school manually. The
charges will then update on the main invoice. You can also print out a
separate concessions order for the school with the link on the sidebar.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_school_concessions.png" title="register_school_concessions.png" width="500">
<p>To see information about money and payments in the aggregate rather than
one school at a time, you can use the &quot;Reports&quot; menu option instead, and
then the &quot;Money/Concessions&quot; section of the sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_reports_index-money.png" title="register_reports_index-money.png" width="300">
<p><strong>Entry Fees &amp; Fines</strong> - Shows an itemized financial report for your
entire tournament, including all entry and judge fees and concessions</p>
<p><strong>Individual School Balances</strong> - Shows a list of all schools and their

<p><strong>List of Fees &amp; Fines</strong> - Shows a report with all levied fines (such as
add/drop nuisance fines or missed judging fees), sorted by school</p>
<p><strong>List of Payments</strong> - Shows a report of all schools that have made

<p><strong>Important Note</strong> - Whether a school is marked as &quot;Registered&quot; or not
has no effect on their entries - their students and judges will still be
considered active, they will still be paired, etc. The Registration
system is just designed to make things easier for you organizationally -
but using it is totally optional.</p>
<p>If online &quot;on-site&quot; registration is enabled, a school can mark
themselves as registered, otherwise you can do it at registration as
schools arrive. To register a school, toggle the &#x27;Confirmed Onsite&#x27;
button in the sidebar. If you accidentally register a school, you can
toggle the same button back to not registered.</p>
<p>The sidebar contains links for a number of useful printouts that can be
used at registration, such as entry sheets, invoices, or judge
assignments.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_school_edit-printouts.png" title="register_school_edit-printouts.png" width="300">
<p>If you want to see the registration status of all schools at once, or
print out registration packets, invoices, or dance cards en-masse, you
use the &quot;Reports&quot; menu option instead of viewing each school
individually. You then use the &quot;Onsite Registration&quot; section of the
sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_reports_index-onsite.png" title="register_reports_index-onsite.png" width="300">
<p>This section lets you view the registration status of each event (so you
know whether an event is ready to be paired), as well as print a list of
registering schools, dance cards, complete registration packets, or any
individual registration item you need, such as invoices or housing
assignments.</p>

or judge assignments, you must first enable them in the Tournament
Settings. For more information, see the section on <a href="/settings/tournament">General
Settings</a>. You also need to toggle the box
in <strong>Settings - Events - Event - Pairing/Sectioning</strong> for &quot;Avoid
in-region matchups in presets,&quot; or assigning regions won&#x27;t do anything.</p>
<p>Once you have enabled them, you have to create the regions you want to
use and then assign each school to a region. You configure regions in
<strong>Entries - Data</strong>, and then the &quot;Edit regions&quot; and &quot;School regions&quot;
options.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_data_index-regions.png" title="register_data_index-regions.png" width="300">

<p>You can manually change their entry name or code, mark whether the entry

entry:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_entry_edit-swap.png" title="register_entry_edit-swap.png" width="300">
<p>To change which student(s) are part of an entry, use the &quot;Swap
Competitors&quot; section and choose a different student from the school&#x27;s
roster in the drop-down list. If they don&#x27;t appear in the list, you can
use the plus sign to &quot;Add competitor not on roster.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong> - When swapping a student in an entry, do NOT click
on the person&#x27;s name in the entry information and then edit it there.
That will make changes to that person&#x27;s record on the school&#x27;s student
roster, and should only be used to fix things like a spelling error. If
you want to REPLACE a student with someone else, use the &quot;Swap
Competitors&quot; section instead.</p>
<p>You can also choose to swap an entry into a different event/division

in the Details section on the sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_entry_edit-havoc.png" title="register_entry_edit-havoc.png" width="300">
<p>Dropping an entry does not automatically remove them from any pairing on
which they currently appear (such as rounds in which they have already
competed or presets), so you may also need to manually change the
schematic to remove them. However, a dropped entry will not be placed on
any future schematics.</p>
<p>Once you have dropped an entry, you can un-drop them by using the link
on the sidebar, or completely delete them from the system by clicking
&quot;Delete Entry Completely.&quot; You should rarely need to completely delete
an entry - it&#x27;s usually better to leave them in the system as a drop so
there&#x27;s a record of what happened and when.</p>
<p>You also have the option of Disqualifying an entry. In debate events,
this has the same effect as dropping them. In IE&#x27;s, it will
automatically give one extra rank to each competitor who ranked behind
the disqualified entry in their rounds.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&#x27;s necessary to re-assign the codes for schools, entries,

an event (such as switching from First/Last to a numeric code), but
already have some entries with the old code style, you can &quot;re-code&quot; the
entire event to make sure all entries have the correct codes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s frequently helpful to run a recode on all events right before you
start pairing- just to ensure that all the entry codes are in the

before pairing the first round to make sure you haven&#x27;t missed anything.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Obligations</strong> - Lists each school and whether they are above or
below their judging obligation for each event.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Room Needs</strong> - Lists all entries or judges that have been marked
as needing ADA accommodations.</p>

<p>Before you can assign seeds to each team for use in pairing preset
rounds, you must first set a preset seeding method in your Event
Settings, in <strong>Settings - Events - Event - Pairing.</strong> For more
information, see the section on <a href="/settings/events">Events</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to choose a pairing method that corresponds to the number of
seed categories and presets you use. For example, if you choose &quot;Hit All
Seed Categories&quot; and have 2 presets, you should have 2 seed categories.</p>
<p>Once you have enabled preset seeding for an event, you will see an
option for &quot;Pairing Seeds&quot; on the sidebar when viewing that event in
<strong>Entries - Events</strong>:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_event_seeds-sidebar.png" title="register_event_seeds-sidebar.png" width="300">
<p>For each entry, you can assign a numeric seed (usually, 1-4), and view
that entry&#x27;s record for help in determining their correct seed
placement. You can also choose to auto-generate seedings based on
tournaments in your region that the entries have previously attended:</p>

<img src="/screenshots/tabs_entries_judges.png" title="tabs_entries_judges.png">
<p>The &quot;Judges&quot; menu option is usually the easiest place to access judge
information, though as with entry information, you can access the same
page through a school&#x27;s info or the schematic.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="judges-overview">Judges Overview<a href="#judges-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Judges Overview" title="Direct link to Judges Overview">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Judges&quot; menu option will first show you an overview of all your
judge categories, including the total number of judges and obligated
rounds in each category, along with hire requests, if any:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_index.png" title="register_judge_index.png" width="500">
<p>The links on the sidebar lets you download a CSV spreadsheet or PDF of
all judges, check school judge burdens, and see which judges have
offered rounds through the hiring exchange. To access broad information
such as how many rounds each judge in the pool has judged so far in the
current season, choose a specific judge category then make your choice
from the sidebar :</p>

<p>To see more detail, you can click on a judge category in the list, or
select it from the sidebar. You will then be shown the list of judges in
that judge category, including their round commitment, code/school, and
any notes included by the coach. Judges marked as &quot;Inactive&quot; will be
shown in red.</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_roster.png" title="register_judge_roster.png" width="600">
<p>Make sure to scan the coaches notes before pairing your first round, as
coaches frequently include availability information in the Notes field
(e.g. &quot;Not available round 1&quot;) instead of using time blocks correctly.</p>
<p>To get more info on the judge group, use the links on the sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_roster-group.png" title="register_judge_roster-group.png" width="300">
<p>This gives you options to see all judges, conflict sheets, the pref
report or the ability to add a new judge to the judge group manually
(for example for a late add or a new hired judge).</p>
<p>To edit the round obligations or hiring availability for all judges in
the group en-masse, you can use the &quot;Round Obligations&quot; link.</p>
<p>To access the information for any individual judge, click their name or
code.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="individual-judge-info">Individual Judge Info<a href="#individual-judge-info" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Individual Judge Info" title="Direct link to Individual Judge Info">​</a></h3>
<p>When viewing an individual judges&#x27; info page, you have a variety of
options:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_edit.png" title="register_judge_edit.png" width="600">
<p>If the event is using online ballots, you will see a box that allows you
to link a judge entry to a Tabroom account manually, or unlink it if it
was linked in error.</p>
<p>You can edit the judges name, judge code, school affiliation, and
contact info, such as email and phone. You can also move a judge to a
different judge group by using the dropdown box, or change which event
they count towards covering an obligation for a school - so for example
you could have a judge in JV covering an Open team&#x27;s judging obligation.</p>
<p>You can also make changes to their round obligation or available hired
rounds, and change which sub-pools they are available for.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can drop the judge using the &quot;Wreak Havoc&quot; section on
the sidebar. Usually, it&#x27;s better to just mark a judge as &quot;Inactive&quot; by
changing the Active button to &quot;No.&quot; That will prevent them from being
paneled, but will make it easy to re-enable them if they become
available again.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="judge-availability--strikes">Judge Availability / Strikes<a href="#judge-availability--strikes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Judge Availability / Strikes" title="Direct link to Judge Availability / Strikes">​</a></h3>
<p>In Tabroom, any reason that a judge can&#x27;t judge a particular debate is
considered a &quot;strike&quot; - so there are several different types of strikes:</p>
<p><strong>MPJ strikes</strong> - given by competitors if you have MPJ configured, this
is what most people normally think of when they think &quot;strike.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Competitor conflicts</strong> - any reason that a judge can&#x27;t judge a
particular student/entry, such as having previously coached them. This
is normally what is thought of as a &quot;preclusion&quot; or &quot;constraint.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>School conflicts</strong> - When a judge can&#x27;t judge a particular school, for
example because they&#x27;ve recently coached there.</p>
<p><strong>Region conflict</strong> - Prevents a judge from judging any school in a
particular region (if using regions in the tournament settings).</p>
<p><strong>Event/Division strike</strong> - Precludes a judge from judging particular
divisions (including just in elims), such as preventing a judge from
judging Open. This is most useful when you have a combined judge group
that can see multiple events.</p>
<p><strong>Time strikes</strong> - Tabroom treats any time during which a judge is
unavailable as a &quot;strike.&quot; So instead of marking a judge as unavailable
for &quot;Round 1,&quot; you have to mark a judge as unavailable for the times
during which you have scheduled Round 1 (e.g. 8-10am for example). This
is because people are usually not available at particular times (e.g.
because of an appointment), not really because that time happens to be
Round 1. Striking a judge by time is ultimately more useful, since a
round may be rescheduled for a variety of reasons - and you would want
the judge to be able to judge that round if it ended up occurring at a
different time at which they were available.</p>
<p>To add any kind of strike (other than MPJ strikes, which are added by
competitors on their pref sheets), you access the judge&#x27;s info sheet and
then click the &quot;Strikes&quot; box at the top:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_edit-strikes.png" title="register_judge_edit-strikes.png" width="500">
<p>You will then be given the option of adding any of the previously
discussed types of strikes:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_judge-strikes.png" title="register_judge_judge-strikes.png" width="500">
<p><strong>Important Note</strong> - When adding a time strike for a judge, be careful
about the end time you select. If you have your schedule configured such
that one round&#x27;s end time is the same as the next round&#x27;s start time,
then a time strike placed on the boundary will prevent the judge being
placed in either round, which is usually not the intended effect. So,
for example, if you have Round 1 configured from 8-10 and Round 2 from
10-12, then giving a judge a time strike from 9-10 will prevent them
judging either Round 1 or 2, because they are &quot;unavailable&quot; at exactly
10am. To prevent this, configure your scheduled time slots so that Round
1 ends at, for example, 9:30 instead of 10, and then give the judge a
time strike from 9-9:55.</p>
<p>To remove any &quot;strike,&quot; view the judge&#x27;s info sheet, and click on the
trash can next to the strike you want to delete on the list in the
sidebar:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_judge-strikes-existing.png" title="register_judge_judge-strikes-existing.png" width="300">
<p>One final option is found under <strong>Entries - Data</strong>, and lets you select
&quot;Mutually conflict schools&#x27; judges&quot; to prevent two schools from judging
each other. This can be useful when two schools share a judging/coaching
staff, for example.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="judging-pref-reports">Judging Pref Reports<a href="#judging-pref-reports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Judging Pref Reports" title="Direct link to Judging Pref Reports">​</a></h3>
<p>To see aggregate information about the prefs for judges in the judge
group, use the &quot;Pref Report&quot; link on the sidebar from the main judge
group screen.. This will show you the average pref and standard
deviation for each judge in the pool, which can help find out who your
&quot;most preferred&quot; judges are, for example to ask them to donate
additional rounds or to ensure you don&#x27;t burn them too early.</p>
<p>Depending on how you configure MPJ for the judge group, you may also
have additional options on the sidebar to see free strikes, check time
block totals or see all conflicts in one place:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_roster-group-prefs.png" title="register_judge_roster-group-prefs.png" width="300">
<p>To see how all entries rated a particular judge, first access that
judge&#x27;s info page, then click the &quot;Pref Sheet in CX (example)&quot; link on
the sidebar.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="school-judging-burdens">School Judging Burdens<a href="#school-judging-burdens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to School Judging Burdens" title="Direct link to School Judging Burdens">​</a></h3>
<p>To check which schools are above or below their judging obligations,
select the &quot;Check School Judging Burdens&quot; link on the sidebar from the
main judges page. You will then see a list of schools and their
outstanding commitment in each judge group:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_judge_check-burdens.png" title="register_judge_check-burdens.png" width="600">
<p>If a school is under their commitment, it will show as &quot;X owed&quot; where X
is the number of rounds they are under. If a school has too much
judging, it will be listed as a negative number and says &quot;-X (over)&quot;
instead. If a school has exactly the right amount to meet their
commitment, that column will be blank.</p>
<p>A related report is available under <strong>Entries - Reports</strong>, and the link
for &quot;Judge Obligations&quot; on the sidebar. This will show you a list of
schools and whether they are above or below their obligation in each
event.</p>

<p>If you are using online ballots for a judge group, you will see an
additional section on the sidebar when viewing that judge group. This
will give you options to manually link judge entries to their Tabroom
accounts, or to approve requests from judges to do the linking (the link
will appear in Red if there are active requests):</p>

hired judging and then let people request hired rounds, and/or you can
enable a &quot;hiring exchange&quot; where judges can offer hired rounds and
schools can hire them without you needing to manually match them up.</p>

<p>Tabroom keeps a log of most of the changes you make to your tournament
as they happen, such as entry drops or pairing a round. The &quot;Change Log&quot;
menu option lets you view these logs, which can make it easier to track
down when something happened or who made a particular change.</p>
<p>First, you should set a date range on the sidebar - it&#x27;s usually helpful
to include a little extra on each side of your range, just in case you
were wrong about the time:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_changes_index-date.png" title="register_changes_index-date.png" width="300">

<p>In addition to adding schools or re-coding entry/judge codes, the &quot;Data&quot;

TRPC.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="importing-data">Importing Data<a href="#importing-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Importing Data" title="Direct link to Importing Data">​</a></h3>
<p>Tabroom can import entry data (including schools and judges) from a
variety of sources, including the &quot;Universal XML&quot; format used by the
TRPC, CAT, and STA, as well as importing registration data from Joy of
Tournaments:</p>
<img src="/screenshots/register_data_index-import.png" title="register_data_index-import.png" width="300">
<p>To import, select the option from the sidebar which matches the source
of your data, and follow the instructions to upload your data file.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong> - For most import methods, such as Joy of
Tournaments, you must have already created the Judge Groups and Events
in Tabroom to exactly match the incoming data. So, for example, if you
have an event in Joy called &quot;LD,&quot; it must also be called &quot;LD&quot; in
Tabroom, not &quot;Lincoln Douglas,&quot; otherwise the import will fail. Make
sure to exactly follow the instructions on screen for your chosen import
method.</p>
<p>Depending on the import method you choose, there may be some data which
cannot be imported automatically - make sure to read the on-screen
instructions for any warnings. For example, when importing Joy of
Tournaments data, time constraints are not imported, but are instead
listed in the &quot;Notes&quot; field for each judge - so you&#x27;ll need to re-enter
them manually.</p>

<p>Tabroom can export your tournament data for use in another tabbing
program, such as TRPC, the CAT, or STA. This can also be useful as a
periodic backup mechanism if the internet were to fail at your
tournament. So, for example, you could save a TRPC export after each
round, so that in an emergency you could load the current state of your
tournament offline and continue tabbing.</p>
<p>To export your data, choose an option from the &quot;Import/Export&quot; section
on the sidebar.</p>
<p>Make sure to read through the on-screen instructions for further
information on using your exported data.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can also completely reset your tournament data using
the link on the sidebar. For obvious reasons, this shouldn&#x27;t be done
once a tournament has started - once you&#x27;ve deleted everything, there&#x27;s
no way to get the data back.</p>
