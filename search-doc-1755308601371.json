On each row, you have the option to Transfer a slot to a competitor. This function is especially useful for tournaments with limited entry space; if you pre-registered a bunch of TBA entries ahead of time, you can use this function to transfer that TBA slot to the signed up competitor. Confirm by hitting the blue arrow-transfer icon.  You can also use the blue checkmark icon to simply accept the signup and register them into the tournament at that time.

Check Qualifiers and Fix Double Qualifiers​  First go into your District tournament once it is complete, and check your qualifiers lists under Results -&gt; Qualifiers. You must confirm that each event was audited and that coaches were able to access ballots &amp; results during the tournament before doing so. The qualifiers should be listed in order.    On this screen you can process your single-entry collisions. The &quot;Choice&quot; column should show what order of choice this entry is for the student. If a student is giving up a slot to Nationals, either because of single entry limitations or because the student is just not going to the tournament, slide the Vacate switch at far right. You should also Vacate entries by alternates who qualified in their preferred events. I'm hoping to automate this process eventually, but for now it has to be worked through manually. Once an entry is Vacated, the system should promote up the next slot. If you had to run a run-off to break a tie, you can schedule that runoff here and enter the results to break the tie.  Once an event's single entry intents have been cleared out, click the orange up arrow at top to generate a Districts results sheet for the event. You can also go through all the events and process your single entry intents, and at the end click the orange up arrow after &quot;ALL&quot; in order to process all of them at once.  2. Look over results sheets &amp; Publish​  Next go to Results =&gt; Web Publish. You will see all your District Qualifiers results sheets listed here, and can click on the &quot;District Qualifiers&quot; tag to see what they look like. The results will be the same from the Qualifiers list you just processed through. Vacated slots will still appear on this results sheet; don't worry about that, they'll be filtered out later.    If anything is in error here, contact Tabroom support or the National office. But if it looks OK, then you can optionally publish this result sheet here to Coaches only or on the public web. Whether or not you decide to publish them, however, you can submit entries to Nationals on the button at right.  3. Final list of qualifiers &amp; Submit​  You will see a list of the students from your district who will be going to Nationals, together with a list of students who had earned a slot to Nationals and for whatever reason (most likely single-entry intents) do not choose to accept a slot to Nationals. You can do a final Vacate here if necessary at right, and the next available slot will be promoted upwards. Vacated entries, like the two DI slots in the example below, will be shown with their codes &amp; names with a strike through them.  You should also see a list of any auto-qualifiers in your district on this sheet as marked. Auto-qualifiers cannot be vacated by you, though the coach can refuse those entries in the Nationals registration process.    Once you have confirmed that all the above information is correct and complete, you can then post your final results to Nationals. Please do not do this casually, it's going to auto-notify your member coaches that everything is set and ready to go when you do it. When you are ready, go all the way to the bottom of the page, and click the checkbox to confirm you have checked it, and then post:    After you have done that, you're all set!  4. Rejections and Alternates​  Because Tabroom has your complete districts data, it can auto-process rejections and promote alternates into Nationals as they are indicated by your member coaches. When a slot is rejected at Nationals by a coach, an automatic notice will be sent to the coach who rejected the slot, the coach of the next alternate available, and you the District Chair if the next alternate is clear. If there is a mistake in any such email, please reply to it right away in order to notify the National Office so it can be rectified.  If the identity of the next alternate is ambiguous because of a tie, then only you will be notified with a request to resolve the tie.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Posting Your Results from Joy of Tournaments​","type":1,"pageTitle":"District Chair Nationals Guide","url":"/administration/district-chair-nationals-guide#posting-your-results-from-joy-of-tournaments","content":" In order to post registrations for Nationals, data from your district tournament must be imported first into Tabroom and then prepared for posting into the National Tournament. In order to do this, you will need the exported data from Joy of Tournaments, which is indicated by a .jot suffix on the file name. The .trn file is not necessary for this process.  You can perform the first 4 steps of this process at any time after the end of each segment of your District tournament. The last 3 steps, however, have to wait for the conclusion of your entire District tournament series.  1. Finding your District Tournament in Tabroom​  First log into Tabroom.com with the account tied to your District chair position. This should be the same email and password as the one you used in the Fall to register your District tournament series. Then, find your District tournament at right. If it has recently finished it will be visible under &quot;Tournaments&quot; on the right sidebar. Otherwise, click &quot;See Past Tournaments&quot; under Tournaments and find your district series on the list that appears.    Once you do that, you should be shunted directly to the JOT Districts interface. We've grouped everything together in one screen with a sequence of steps listed at right. You can return to this screen if you end up elsewhere by going to the Results menu at top and selecting JOT Results.    2. Uploading the JOT Data​  Click the first step, Upload Data, at right. You should be presented with an upload interface where you can upload your .jot tournament data file. Click on Choose File, select your .jot file, and then click Upload.    Once you run the uploader, you will see a large log of data being processed. It can't hurt to scan it for errors and the like, but for the most part the most common error will be that students' NSDA records cannot be found, and there will be a chance later to reconcile that easier. Once the process finishes you'll see a navigation menu to the right. Click Return to Districts Import to head to the next step.    3. Adjusting Congress chambers​  If you have uploaded Congress results, you have to do a small bit of tweaking to line up the correct chambers to the correct events. The way that Joy and Tabroom store Congress is very different and is hard to reconcile automatically. Therefore, just scan over the following screen and make sure all the chambers from Joy are arranged in their correct divisions (House vs Senate), rounds, and that if you ran Super Sessions/Finals, that they are marked as &quot;Final&quot; rounds at the far right. The correct time blocks don't much matter, as long as the rounds are properly numbered. If you change the round number or round type of one chamber of a round, all the chambers in that round will be changed.    Once you save the chambers, it will bring you to the next step.  4. Confirming NSDA Memberships​  We have to make sure the NSDA records for a school and student are correctly linked for them to enter Nationals. In the vast majority of cases, the schools will link to their records properly and be reconciled. But in a few cases, either students who were not previously entered in Tabroom or students who were entered manually into the JOT system during the tournament might not be linked to their record. The next screen allows you to confirm that NSDA memberships are linked properly.  When you go to this screen, first ensure that all your schools are linked to their proper NSDA account. If a school is linked a green check will appear next to it. If a school is unlinked, you can select the school from your district that corresponds to it, and save.    Below the school list, any students who do not have an active found NSDA membership will also be listed. Select the NSDA member student in the pulldown menu next to them to reconcile their membership. In most cases it will be a student who has their name listed somewhat differently (Mike vs Michael, etc). The system will try to find the closest matching student. If the student does not appear, then contact the National office.    5. Generate Results Sheets​  Click on this step to generate your results sheets. (If you're curious, you can also check out the calculations for your qualifiers under the Results menu, Qualifiers screen before you do this, but that's not necessary).  Click Generate Results Sheets at the top. You will then get a District Qualifiers report listing for all your District events below.    You should click each one to verify they are correct. If anything on this screen is wrong, please contact help@tabroom.com or the National Office at info@speechanddebate.org with details.    Once the sheets are correctly generated, go to the next step.  6. Post Registrations to Nationals​  Here you should see the final confirmation of students who will be going to Nationals. Here you also can process single entry intents; any student who is not going to attend Nationals in a certain slot (because they qualified in their other preferred event, for instance) should be marked as Vacated using the switch at far right. Once a slot is vacated, the next slot should be promoted up to qualify for Nationals. Vacated entries, like the two DI slots in the example below, will be shown with their codes &amp; names with a strike through them.  You should also see a list of any auto-qualifiers in your district on this sheet as marked. Auto-qualifiers cannot be vacated by you, though the coach can refuse those entries in the Nationals registration process.    Once you have confirmed that all the above information is correct and complete, you can then post your final results to Nationals. Please do not do this casually, it's going to auto-notify your member coaches that everything is set and ready to go when you do it. When you are ready, go all the way to the bottom of the page, and click the check box to confirm you have checked it, and then post:    After you have done that, you're all set!  7. Rejections and Alternates​  Because Tabroom has your complete districts data, it can auto-process rejections and promote alternates into Nationals as they are indicated by your member coaches. When a slot is rejected at Nationals by a coach, an automatic notice will be sent to the coach who rejected the slot, the coach of the next alternate available, and you the District Chair if the next alternate is clear. If there is a mistake in any such email, please reply to it right away in order to notify the National Office so it can be rectified.  If the identity of the next alternate is ambiguous because of a tie, then only you will be notified with a request to resolve the tie.

These coaches will not necessarily receive coach points credit for the students' performance; you will be able to select that this summer after the tournament when the points are posted.  Then hit save below. The teams will be saved; team members will be visible to coaches as they register for Nationals as well.

You can use this feature if you know a student should be on your roster. It is likely they were automatically graduated and made inactive. You will need to reactivate them using this option.  Remove Duplicates​  If you accidentally created duplicates on your student roster, you could easily remove them by using the &quot;de-duplicate students&quot; link on the sidebar. If any duplicates are found, you will be given the choice to merge them. Please be sure that you're merging duplicate students, rather than two different students with the same name. There are times when you will receive a message saying the graduation dates are too far apart. To fix this issue, change the graduation date for the duplicated student and run the merge process again.    Dietary Preferences​  Your student roster is a convenient place to keep track of your student's dietary preferences, which also makes it easy for tournaments to access that information. You can see all of this information in one place with the &quot;Dietary preferences&quot; link in the sidebar:    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Linking Your National Speech & Debate Association Roster​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Coaches","url":"/account/coaches#linking-your-national-speech--debate-association-roster","content":" Linking your Tabroom student roster to your account with the National Speech &amp; Debate Association allows you to automatically import your students, and also enables &quot;auto-pointing,&quot; where a student's honor points can be posted automatically. To take advantage of this, click the &quot;Students&quot; tab to view your Student Roster. Then, click the link on the right for &quot;Connect to NSDA Auto Pointing:&quot;    First, you'll need to give Tabroom access to your Points Application account with the National Speech &amp; Debate Association. Enter the username and password you use to log in to the Points Application (points.speechanddebate.org), and then type the &quot;confirmation phrase&quot; in the on-screen instructions. This is to prevent accidental linking to the wrong school.  If successful, you will see your list of linked Points App logins (with the option to &quot;Unlink&quot; if you made a mistake). You'll then need to select your NSDA school from the dropdown menu (just in case your Points App login is attached to more than one school), and click &quot;Link to NSDA.&quot;  Tabroom will then show you the list of current students on your Tabroom roster (if any), and ask you to link each student with the correct entry from your roster with the National Speech &amp; Debate Association. This is to ensure that each student is matched with the correct merit number. Using the dropdown menu for each student, choose a name, or &quot;Do not link&quot; if a student is not a member of the National Speech &amp; Debate Association. You must also check the &quot;Confirm&quot; box next to each student.  Once you have linked students, you will see them appear on this screen with their Tabroom and NSDA roster information, current number of honor society points, along with the option to delink them from their Tabroom entry.  Once the initial linking of your Tabroom school to your National Speech &amp; Debate Association account is done, you can import any students on your NSDA roster to Tabroom by choosing the &quot;Import NSDA Roster to Tabroom.com&quot; option on the sidebar.  This will show you a list of students from your NSDA roster that are available to import (with the option to exclude any you don't want).  After you've imported your students, you can verify that they're linked correctly by clicking their name from your student roster. Their &quot;NSDA Merit Number&quot; will be displayed at the bottom.  That's it - once a tournament is complete, you should see the points appear on the NSDA Points Application in the &quot;Autopost&quot; section of your school profile, where you can confirm them and choose a coach to assign coach points.  Note that for points to be autoposted, you'll need to have your rosters correctly linked prior to Tabroom processing that tournament's results. That is, autoposting points isn't retroactive - if you didn't link rosters prior to a tournament, you won't see those points.  Also note that for the time being, Congress points are not autoposted and will need to be input manually.  For auto-pointing to work correctly, the tournament director should opt-in by matching up their tournament events on Tabroom with the appropriate Association events in their tournament settings. If you want to ensure you get credit for points at a tournament you're attending, make sure to tell the tournament director you'd like them to do so.

You can link judges on your roster to their Tabroom accounts later if you wish.  If you want to add a large number of judges at once, you can also use the &quot;Import from Spreadsheet&quot; option, which is found in the sidebar on your Students tab (not the Judge tab). For more information, see the section on Adding Students From A File above. Make sure you use the &quot;Judge&quot; template, instead of the &quot;Student&quot; template.  Once you have added judges to your roster, they will appear in a list:    Clicking on a judge's first or last name will let you edit their information. You can also toggle a judge between active/inactive to keep your roster easier to manage. You can select whether to see active or inactive judges on the sidebar.  If you accidentally created duplicates on your judge roster, you can easily remove them by using the &quot;Deduplicate judges&quot; link on the sidebar. If any duplicates are found, you will be given the choice to merge them:  First, Last – Name of the judge that will be visible on tabroom.com. Clicking any of these names will allow you to edit the full judge record, including linking them to their tabroom.com account.  Judged – Indicates the number of tournaments they've judged on tabroom.com. This record will only reflect the tournaments their linked account was attached to and not other tournaments where they may have judged prior to having an account.  Phone – Indicates the phone number they have registered on their tabroom.com account.  Linked To – Indicates the tabroom.com linked account email.  Inactive – By default all judges are active. If a judge is no with your program, toggle this to a red &quot;Y&quot; and they will be disabled from your roster.

Some circuits are run entirely on a tournament-only basis, such as the US National Circuit (HS).  &quot;Full Membership&quot; means you will be able to register for tournaments, and will receive emails about the circuit. You may also be billed for membership dues. This is best for joining a state or local circuit that uses Tabroom to manage its membership.

Make sure to log into the Tabroom account corresponding to the email address you got the notice from; some folks have multiple school records and Tabroom accounts and might not get their Nationals registration on the first one. (If you do have multiple schools records and accounts, and find this annoying, send an email to help@tabroom.com with the details and we can merge your divided identity together.) There is a &quot;forgotten password&quot; function beneath the Login box if you do not remember your Tabroom password.  If you have never used Tabroom at all, your username is the email address you got notified of your school from, and your password is the same as your NSDA website account.  Once you log in, you should see the National Tournament already listed under the tournaments you are registered for:    Click Enter on the right of the tournament.  Then you will be asked how you would like your judge bond refunded to you. The options and policies around judge bonds have changed this year so please read the disclaimer carefully.    Once you select your refund amount you will be asked to provide the details of the adult/emergency contact who will be present at Nationals, and which hotel you are staying in. There is a new entry fee discount in 2018 Nationals so the hotel answer is important to calculating your final charges.    Entries​  After you provide hotel information and adult contact information, you will see a series of tabs along the top of the screen. That'll be where you can do the rest of your nationals registration. First, click Entires, and you should see your qualified entries to Nationals listed out by event:    Click ACCEPT to accept an entry to Nationals, or REJECT to Reject that entry. When you reject an entry, a confirmation screen will require you to confirm the entry's rejection; the system will automatically inform and promote the alternate slot, so please do not do this unless you are certain.  Once you have accepted an entry into their main event, then you can click the blue edit icon under the Details header at the right to fill in additional information about the entry, and register them for Supplementals and Consolations.  First, select the supplemental events you wish to pre-register the entry for, and click Register Supplementals. If you change your mind about which Supps and Cons you want the student in, you can change them here at any time before the May deadline:    Then, in the next section, you can download, fill out and then re-upload a scanned copy of the student's mandatory video and release form. You can also provide a phonetic pronunciation guide if you wish:    Next, for each entry (Mains and Supplementals) you will be asked to provide various information. For all events you will need to supply the coach of record to receive points credit, and the coach names you wish read at awards should the student qualify for recognition. In several events you will be asked for more information, such as piece titles, script uploads, and the like. You can also here drop entries that you have already accepted if it's prior to the May deadline.    Once you have finished you can click the Entries tab at top, or &quot;Return to School Entry&quot; at top right, to return to the student listing. You will see any Supplementals/Consolations listed now under the student. Once all the required information, forms, etc have been uploaded the red X on the far right will turn into a green checkmark:    Judges​  Under the Judges tab , you will first be shown your current judging obligations by round and category. If you owe judges in Big Questions or are supplying judges in World Schools, you will see those listed underneath the Main Tournament judges.    Click on Add MAIN judge to add a judge to the main tournament. At first you have multiple ways to add a new judge. On the left hand side you can add a judge who is not in the Tabroom system for your school, does not have a Tabroom account and is not a listed coach under your NSDA membership record. On the right, you can add judges for whom one or more of those things are present. Feel free to input a judge who is both on your Tabroom roster AND is an NSDA coach AND has a Tabroom account by inputting all three; the more information we have the better the tournament runs:    Save the judge and more information will appear. The first task is to designate the judge for a number of rounds (no more than 8) and which judge pool/categories the judge should be considered for. Select all that apply. If you select Congress, you will further be asked whether your prefer to judge Congress (if you select this, changes are very high you will be pooled to Congress) and whether or not you are qualified and willing to serve as a Parliamentarian in Congress.  If you select Policy or LD, a Paradigm questionnaire will appear at right. We are also striving this year to better track and promot the full range of diverse voices and viewpoints possible in judging, especially in elimination rounds. If you want to self identify as a Diverse judge you can do so on this screen. Any and all judges can optionally fill out the Diversity Questionnaire at right as well. Identifying as diversity enhancing will not change how much you have to judge, though it may change which rounds you are assigned for.  If you link the judge to a Tabroom.com account they will be able to fill out their own Paradigm Form and Diversity Questionnaire from their Tabroom account as well.  Finally this year you may also self-nominate your judges for semifinals and finals pools. In the past this was only done by District Chairs, but any and all who wish to be considered for a Semi or Finals round may do so. Provide as much additional info about your judging qualifications as you think would be helpful to us. Please also be aware that if you are pooled into a semi or final round because you self identified, failure to show up will count as bond forfeiture. So before self-nominating be sure you will be at the tournament on Thursday and Friday.    Once you save the judges you can click the Judges tab at the top, and/or the Return button at top right, to return to your Judging listing. Once you have done that, you can see how far along towards meeting your judging commitment you are. Use the &quot;Request Hires&quot; box to specify how many rounds you may wish to hire out for, with the caveat that Policy and PF rounds may not be hired ,and at least 6 rounds of judging must be supplied by the school.    Concessions​  Use the Concessions tab to order T-Shirts or purchase a School Resource Package. You can select the item below, and then click the green Order Now button to specify sizes and quantities:    Choose each size you want and how many of that size and hit Save:    Once you have saved a few orders, you can see and cancel your current order status at right:    Fees &amp; Payments​  Finally you can go to the Fees tab once all is confirmed and your judging is set. You will see your fees listed out. Be sure you are being charged properly for the supps and cons, main events, and judging you have hired. if you are short on requested judging there will be very high penalty fees, for example. Your hotel discount will be applied here as well if you are staying in a block hotel.  When you are ready to confirm and pay, click on &quot;Invoice your NSDA Account&quot; at right. That will create you an invoice in the NSDA accounting system and transfer you to the NSDA main website for payment, where you can pay via your normal methods that you've used to pay for memberships, etc.    If you have additional charges later on, such as through added entries due to changed supplementals entries or promoted alternates, you can always return to this screen and create another invoice for the remaining balance, and pay that. Any over-payments will be resolved after the National tournament.

Once the initial linking of your Tabroom school to your National Speech &amp; Debate Association account is done, you can import any students on your NSDA roster to Tabroom by choosing the &quot;Import NSDA Roster to Tabroom.com&quot; option on the sidebar.  This will show you a list of students from your NSDA roster that are available to import (with the option to exclude any you don't want).  After you've imported your students, you can verify that they're linked correctly by clicking their name from your student roster. Their &quot;NSDA Merit Number&quot; will be displayed at the bottom.  That's it - once a tournament is complete, you should see the points appear on the NSDA Points Application in the &quot;Autopost&quot; section of your school profile, where you can confirm them and choose a coach to assign coach points.  Note that for points to be autoposted, you'll need to have your rosters correctly linked prior to Tabroom processing that tournament's results. That is, autoposting points isn't retroactive - if you didn't link rosters prior to a tournament, you won't see those points.  Also note that for the time being, Congress points are not autoposted and will need to be input manually.  For auto-pointing to work correctly, the tournament director should opt-in by matching up their tournament events on Tabroom with the appropriate Association events in their tournament settings. If you want to ensure you get credit for points at a tournament you're attending, make sure to tell the tournament director you'd like them to do so.

Clicking on an entry's name and selecting &quot;Piece/Quals&quot; will show you a link to the video that was uploaded.  • Tabroom.com will automatically drop any entries that it does not find a matching name for in your CSV. This is helpful to automate the drop process for students who do not submit videos, but we recommend going through the students who were auto-dropped (Entries &gt; Events &gt; select event &gt; Drops) and confirming that they did not submit videos.  Tip: If a student's name has characters like hyphens or apostrophes, the system may struggle to match it to the upload. Make sure you double check that entries were not erroneously dropped due to these characters. Additionally, it is important that students upload their videos under the exact name they are listed under in Tabroom.com in order for the matching process to work.

Remember—we suggest that rooms host no more than 15 people at a time. If you need a room that can easily manage more than 15 people, you may want to set up a room on a different platform (e.g., Zoom) for better quality.  To set up a utility room using an external platform like Zoom, follow the instructions above and change the dropdown from &quot;NSDA Campus&quot; to &quot;External Service&quot; next to the utility room in question. Then, paste a link to the external room and save.  If you plan to have a large group spanning multiple events to meet in one external room, create a separate utility room for each judge category and paste the same link for each utility room. For example, if you want all PF, LD, and CX judges to meet in one Judge Pooling room in Zoom, create a Judge Pooling room for PF judges, a separate Judge Pooling room for LD judges, and a separate Judge Pooling room for CX judges. Change all the dropdowns from &quot;NSDA Campus&quot; to &quot;External Service&quot; and paste the same Zoom link for all three of the utility rooms.

For $14 per room per day, a tournament director can purchase rooms that allow coaches to designate observers on a per-round and per-entry basis. An event or division using Campus with Observers must do so for the entirety of the tournament; it is not possible to purchase normal NSDA Campus rooms for one day and Campus with Observer rooms for a different day.  Due to technical limits on the number of participants in Campus rooms, Campus with Observers is limited to 2 observers per entry in debate events or 1 observer per entry in speech events. In order to preserve the quality of competition, Campus with Observers cannot work with Congress. Campus with Observers is intended to be a way for coaches to observe their students in round; to allow non-coaches or large audiences to view rounds, please consider live streaming!  If your students are competing in an event using Campus with Observers rooms, you can designate observers from the tournament dashboard. Only Tabroom.com accounts with Coach/Administrator access to your school in Tabroom.com (which can be designated on the Access tab) may be designated as observers.    Coaches may designate observers on their school tournament dashboard on a per-entry basis. Those observers can then enter rooms from the tournament dashboard. Coaches can change observers at any time during a tournament. However, once one observer in speech or two in debate enters a room, no other coaches can enter that room for your entry, even if observer permissions are changed on the dashboard or if they leave the room.

We will continue to add tips as they are shared with NSDA Staff. Ensure all participants are linked on Tabroom in advance. For more information about linking accounts,please review this video.  Stagger start times - It works best to stagger round blasts/start times for different events by at least 5 minutes. This helps with server load, so that everyone at the tournament isn't joining their room at the exact same time. Additionally, users will not be able to access rooms/rounds until after the time your tournament &quot;starts.&quot; Consider setting your tournament start time as an hour before your rounds are scheduled.Less &quot;in room&quot; wait time - The less time users are in rooms the better! No need for users to be in rooms for thirty minutes to an hour before start time!Back up Plan - Some users may not be able to access NSDA Campus rooms for reasons neither you nor the NSDA can control (such as school content filters). Have a backup plan for rooms outside of the NSDA Campus platform for those unique situations. Consider using Zoom, Google Meets, or other virtual platforms.Understand the NSDA's Backup Procedures - In the event of a widespread technical issue, the NSDA has multiple backup plans to switch infrastructure and ensure Campus will continue to operate. In that case, the best thing to do is have your participants close their rooms, wait 5-10 minutes, and come back in via Tabroom/Speechwire. There usually will be no need to postpone rounds more than that, repair, or take other drastic action unless told otherwise by the NSDA.

The NSDA has multiple backup plans, and can almost always get things back on track in a short timeframe. In the event of major issues, we can also move participants over to backup servers, either piecemeal or all at once, as the situation requires. Each of these steps only takes a few minutes, so stay patient. Unless you hear otherwise from NSDA Staff, there's no need to move all rooms to a different platform, redo round pairings, or postpone your schedule. Most glitches can be dealt with by a short 5-10 minute pause: have everyone leave their rooms, wait a few minutes for us to fix the problem, then try to re-enter their room via Tabroom/Speechwire. Repeatedly reloading the page will just make things worse. Once the NSDA has remedied the source of the problem, rooms should go back to working again as normal.  If you experience problems, attempt to determine whether the issue is actually with NSDA Campus, or with individual participants. If you're only getting reports of issues from some participants, the issue is very unlikely to be with Campus itself. If every room simultaneously starts having issues (e.g. mass disconnections or &quot;kick outs&quot;), it is more likely to be a Campus-wide issue.  We now have a centralized status dashboard for all NSDA Services: NSDA STATUS  In the event of any glitches or downtime with Campus or Tabroom (or other NSDA services), this site will be kept up to date with the issue, the planned fix, and any expected time for resolution. We strongly suggest you check this site first before emailing or calling the NSDA office - it will be the fastest way to get info out to everyone.

Settings - Rules &amp; Results Decide if the built-in Tiebreak sets are sufficient, or if your league rules require setting up your own. Create them if necessary.For each Tiebreak set you use, decide if you want to uncheck the box for &quot;No shows/forfeits cannot break/advance.&quot;If you have speech events, decide if your speech tiebreaks will use &quot;Truncate Ranks&quot; and configure them on the Tiebreakers tab.If you give Sweepstakes awards, configure a rule set on the Sweepstakes tab.If your tournament gives NDCA Points or TOC bids, configure them on the &quot;Points &amp; Bids&quot; tab. Settings - Judges (Repeat for each judge group) Create judge groups. Most tournaments will have one judge group for all IE's, one for congress, and one for each division of debate events. Some tournaments use a combined judge group for all divisions of a single debate event (i.e. one judge group for both open and novice CX). Make sure to give each judge group an abbreviation.Register Tab - Most tournament will want to check &quot;Suppress Judge Codes (names only)&quot; and &quot;Publish the list of judges online&quot; so judges can find themselves more easily.Register Tab - Check the option for &quot;Ask for judge phone #s at registration&quot; - It's almost always good to collect as much contact info as you can.Register Tab - If using online ballots, consider checking the &quot;Require judges to have linked accounts&quot; option. It will offload some of the linking to pre-tournament, rather than during round 1.Register Tab - set one of the two judge burden methods, usually &quot;Entries per judge owed&quot; for IE's, or &quot;Rounds owed per entry&quot; for debate.Register Tab - set a fee for missed rounds of judging.Hires Tab - If offering hired judging or using a hiring exchange, use the Hires tab to configure.Tabbing Tab - Check the box for &quot;Judges can get the same event twice&quot; unless it's an IE judge pool with lots of extra judges.Tabbing Tab - Most tournaments will want to check &quot;Allow panels w/ same school judges.&quot;Tabbing Tab - If using MPJ, decide if you want to adjust the MPJ placement weights. If not, the defaults are fine.Ratings Tab - If using MPJ, configure on the Ratings tab by choosing a &quot;Pref Method&quot; and, if applicable, using the &quot;MPJ Tiers&quot; tab to configure tiers.Part Timers Tab - if you predict a large number of part-time judges, such as &quot;Saturday Only&quot; judges, configure part-timer blocks.Pools Tab - Create a Judge Pool for each elim round, which you will auto-populate later with only obligated judges. Settings - Events (Repeat for each event) Create Events. The &quot;Add New Event&quot; form has a variety of options you should set for all events. Make sure to give each event an abbreviation, set an entry fee for the event, set the minimum/maximum number of competitors per entry (they will be 1 or 2 unless you have an exotic event), ensure the event is in the right judge group, and choose an entry code format under &quot;Designate entries.&quot; Also make sure to set the correct &quot;Event Type&quot; (e.g. Policy, LD, Speech) - only use the generic &quot;Debate&quot; for non-standard events.Registration Tab - If you need to set an entry cap, do so here.Tabulation Tab - Choose a &quot;Preset seeding&quot; method. If using a method other than &quot;random&quot; make sure to add preset seeds after you have all your entries.Tabulation Tab - Choose a tiebreak set to use for speaker awards, if applicable for each event.Tabulation Tab - Check the &quot;Use live updates (Text/Email)&quot; box.Tabulation Tab - If using Online Ballots, check the &quot;Online Ballot Entry&quot; box.Tabulation Tab - Set a minimum and maximum for speaker points, and if applicable, online ballot points.Tabulation Tab - Set the &quot;Point Increments.&quot; Most tournaments use either .10 or Half. Choose whether to allow Tied Points.Tabulation Tab - Set the option for &quot;Auto-publish results once next round is paired&quot; to &quot;Full Results.&quot; That way, you don't have to worry about manually setting each round's results to public.Tabulation Tab - For most tournaments, check the box for &quot;Allow repeat judging in elims.&quot;Tabulation Tab - If you have a very small tournament or very tight judging pool. consider using some of the options in the &quot;Judging&quot; section to remove some common judging restraints (such as allowing repeat judging.&quot;Ballot &amp; Rules Tab - If desired, add a message/point scale to the ballot.If allowing double-entry, configure double-entry limits after configuring all events. Settings - Schedule Create Timeslots for each day of the tournament. Usually, you will want a separate timeslot for each round of each event, even if the times are the same, to more easily facilitate changing the schedule if necessary. Make sure timeslots don't start at the same time as the previous timeslot (e.g. use 8-9:30 and 10-11:30, NOT 8-10 and 10-12).Schedule rounds for each event into the appropriate timeslots. Add a label for each elim round. Make sure to set the round type (Prelim, Hi/Lo, Elim, etc) and a Tiebreak set for each round.Double check the schedule again, and make sure you have a round type and tiebreak set for each round. The most common problems are created by failing to double check the schedule.If double-flighting an event, set the number of flights on the schedule. Settings - Sites &amp; Rooms Create a site for your tournament, and if necessary a separate site for your hotel (if holding elims there). Then add all your rooms to the site. Include quality ratings for each room if desired.Create a room pool for each event (or at least each judge group), and place the appropriate rooms into each pool.Assign every round of every event to the appropriate room pool. Verify that you haven't schedule the same room in two different pools during the same timeslot. Settings - Money Use the C.R.E.A.M. box to scan through all your entry fees, judge fees, and nuisance fines. Most should already have been set during your judge group and event setup.If offering concessions, configure t hem. Settings - Website Add any desired information to the standard website pages - for example, consider putting the text of your invitation on the &quot;Main Page&quot; so it's the first thing people see.Take note of your tournament website address, for publicizing during registration and once the tournaments starts as a centralized location for tournament info.

Swapping An Entry​  Using the tools on the sidebar, you can make a variety of swaps for an entry:    To change which student(s) are part of an entry, use the &quot;Swap Competitors&quot; section and choose a different student from the school's roster in the drop-down list. If they don't appear in the list, you can use the plus sign to &quot;Add competitor not on roster.&quot;  Important Note - When swapping a student in an entry, do NOT click on the person's name in the entry information and then edit it there. That will make changes to that person's record on the school's student roster, and should only be used to fix things like a spelling error. If you want to REPLACE a student with someone else, use the &quot;Swap Competitors&quot; section instead.  You can also choose to swap an entry into a different event/division (for example moving an entry in Open down to JV), or switch which school an entry is affiliated with.  Dropping An Entry​  To Drop or Disqualify an entry, use the &quot;Drop &amp; Stop Scheduling&quot; button in the Details section on the sidebar:    Dropping an entry does not automatically remove them from any pairing on which they currently appear (such as rounds in which they have already competed or presets), so you may also need to manually change the schematic to remove them. However, a dropped entry will not be placed on any future schematics.  Once you have dropped an entry, you can un-drop them by using the link on the sidebar, or completely delete them from the system by clicking &quot;Delete Entry Completely.&quot; You should rarely need to completely delete an entry - it's usually better to leave them in the system as a drop so there's a record of what happened and when.  You also have the option of Disqualifying an entry. In debate events, this has the same effect as dropping them.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Judge Availability / Strikes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Managing Entries","url":"/quick-start/managing-entries#judge-availability--strikes","content":" In Tabroom, any reason that a judge can't judge a particular debate is considered a &quot;strike&quot; - so there are several different types of strikes:  MPJ strikes - given by competitors if you have MPJ configured, this is what most people normally think of when they think &quot;strike.&quot;  Competitor conflicts - any reason that a judge can't judge a particular student/entry, such as having previously coached them. This is normally what is thought of as a &quot;preclusion&quot; or &quot;constraint.&quot;  School conflicts - When a judge can't judge a particular school, for example because they've recently coached there.  Region conflict - Prevents a judge from judging any school in a particular region (if using regions in the tournament settings).  Event/Division strike - Precludes a judge from judging particular divisions (including just in elims), such as preventing a judge from judging Open. This is most useful when you have a combined judge group that can see multiple events.  Time strikes - Tabroom treats any time during which a judge is unavailable as a &quot;strike.&quot; So instead of marking a judge as unavailable for &quot;Round 1,&quot; you have to mark a judge as unavailable for the times during which you have scheduled Round 1 (e.g. 8-10am for example). This is because people are usually not available at particular times (e.g. because of an appointment), not really because that time happens to be Round 1. Striking a judge by time is ultimately more useful, since a round may be rescheduled for a variety of reasons - and you would want the judge to be able to judge that round if it ended up occurring at a different time at which they were available.  To add any kind of strike (other than MPJ strikes, which are added by competitors on their pref sheets), you access the judge's info sheet and then click the &quot;Strikes&quot; box at the top:    You will then be given the option of adding any of the previously discussed types of strikes:    Important Note - When adding a time strike for a judge, be careful about the end time you select. If you have your schedule configured such that one round's end time is the same as the next round's start time, then a time strike placed on the boundary will prevent the judge being placed in either round, which is usually not the intended effect. So, for example, if you have Round 1 configured from 8-10 and Round 2 from 10-12, then giving a judge a time strike from 9-10 will prevent them judging either Round 1 or 2, because they are &quot;unavailable&quot; at exactly 10am. To prevent this, configure your scheduled time slots so that Round 1 ends at, for example, 9:30 instead of 10, and then give the judge a time strike from 9-9:55.  To remove any &quot;strike,&quot; view the judge's info sheet, and click on the trash can next to the strike you want to delete on the list in the sidebar:    One final option is found under Entries - Data, and lets you select &quot;Mutually conflict schools' judges&quot; to prevent two schools from judging each other.

A &quot;Judge Category&quot; is a collection of judges which can be used in one or more events or divisions. Every event must be in one and only one judge category. For example, you might have a category of judges that can judge either the novice or open divisions of policy, a second judge category exclusively for congress judges, and a third category of judges which could judge any other IE event.  It may seem odd to set up your judge categories before setting up your events - just remember that a single category of judges may be used across multiple events, but a single event will only ever pull from a single judge category. This means it makes more sense to assign events to judge categories than the other way around.  Note that a Judge CATEGORY is different than a Judge POOL - Judge Pools are used to draw from a specific subset of judges in the larger judge category - for example, only the judges that are still obligated for the semi-finals.  After creating or selecting a judge category from the sidebar, you'll see a list of tabs with the settings for that judge category:    Register - General settings for the judge category. The most important option to set is choosing a &quot;burden method&quot; to compute judge obligations. You should also make sure to set an abbreviation for each judge category. Most of the time, the rest of the default options are fine.  Hires - If you plan to offer hired judging at the tournament, or want to enable a &quot;hiring exchange&quot; where judges and schools can match up with each other, configure it here.  Tabbing - Contains options about how judges are placed, a few MPJ-related options, and lets you choose a method for ballot entry (i.e. whether you have to double-enter each ballot). The defaults on this tab are usually sufficient for most situations.  Ratings - This is where you configure mutually-preferred judging. For the most part, all you need to do is double check the date/time that prefs open and close, and then choose a &quot;Pref Method,&quot; whether using Ordinals or Tiers.  MPJ Tiers - If you enabled a tier-based MPJ method on the Ratings tab, this tab will appear and let you configure them.  Time Shifts - If you have a number of judges likely to be unavailable for large blocks of the tournament (such as judges that only come on Saturday), you can configure time shifts here that allow registering schools to mark their judges as &quot;unavailable&quot; during certain times. If you just have a few judges that need to miss a round here or there, you probably don't need to use this - you can instead just add a time strike for that judge. Make sure you read the directions on this tab for how to name your time blocks, to help avoid confusion.  Pools - This lets you configure sub-pools of judges from the larger judge category, for example only judges still obligated in an elimination round. Using these is optional, but can make your life easier. You can also create pools as you go through the tournament, so leaving them alone during the initial configuration is fine.  Messages - This lets you configure and send any information out to judges like live doc links, conflict policies, and school registration notices.  For more information, see the section onJudge Groups.

Once you have created or selected an event on the sidebar, you will have a number of tabs with options for that event:    Main - General settings that you set when you created the event. Make sure you set a minimum and maximum number of competitors per entry (almost always both 1 for Speech, Congress, and LD, 2 for both PF and Policy, and 3 minimum and 5 maximum for WSD). You should also set the appropriate event &quot;Type&quot; so that Tabroom knows what types of options to show you for that event. If you have NSDA members attending your tournament, you'll also see an option to select an NSDA event type for each event. You must choose this event type for each event to enable NSDA auto-pointing.  Registration - The defaults on this tab are usually good for most situations. Primarily useful if you need to set a cap on the number of entries or use a waitlist.  Online - Lets you choose whether your event is being held online or in person. If your tournament is being held online, you can choose the type of NSDA Campus rooms you need for each event (ex: rooms to allow observers, no observers, etc.). This tab will also allow you to setup whether your speech events will occur asynchronously using uploaded video links and whether your tournament events will occur synchronously with pre-created room URLs.  Sectioning/Chambers/Pairing - This tab allows you to set specifics related to the pairing, judging, and web publishing in each event of your tournament.  Tabulation - The most commonly set item on this tab is to enable Online Ballots. Make sure you set a number for minimum and maximum speaker points - otherwise your online ballots will appear blank. You can also enable use of online coin flips in this tab. The default settings for powermatching, judges, and results should be fine for most situations - but if you need to change something like how presets are paired, this is where you do it.  Ballot &amp; Rules - Lets you configure the appearance of the ballot for the event. The default is fine if you don't want to mess around with it.  Updates - Completely optional, lets you have an email sent to someone (e.g. a tab person) when the first and last ballots are in for each round.  To learn more, see the section on setting upEvents.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Schedule​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tournament Quick Start","url":"/quick-start/quick-start#schedule","content":" The Schedule tab tends to be one of the areas which confuses first-timers the most. You'll proceed in two parts - setting up timeslots, and then scheduling rounds from different events in those timeslots.  Tabroom divides up your schedule into &quot;Timeslots&quot; rather than Rounds. Each timeslot can then have one or more rounds (from one or more events) assigned to it. Different timeslots can also overlap, for example if you had different events running at different sites that started at different overlapping times. You can also have multiple timeslots with identical start/end times but different names for different events if it helps you keep things straight - like an 8-10 slot for Policy and an 8-10 slot for IE's. For an example, see the image below.  First, create your timeslots, which should largely mimic your tournament schedule. Then, click each event on the sidebar and schedule rounds in the appropriate timeslots:    This is also where you can select whether to double-flight rounds for a particular event.  IMPORTANT TIP - For each round you schedule, you must select a &quot;Type&quot; and a &quot;Tiebreaks&quot; set. Otherwise, Tabroom won't know how to pair the round, and won't know what information to collect from judges on the ballot. This is probably the single most common mistake people make when setting up their tournament.  For a more in-depth explanation of timeslots and scheduling rounds, see the section on Schedule.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Sites & Rooms​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Tournament Quick Start","url":"/quick-start/quick-start#sites--rooms","content":" Sites &amp; Rooms is where you enter your list of available rooms. You can then create &quot;Room Pools&quot; for each event, so that they stay in the same rooms.  On Tabroom, a &quot;Site&quot; is a grouping of all the rooms at one tournament location, such as a campus or hotel. Odds are, you'll only need one &quot;site,&quot; even if you use multiple buildings. You only need to create multiple sites if your tournament is very large and spread over completely different locations (such as two separate high schools, or a campus and a hotel).  Once you have created a site, you can either enter the rooms manually or import them from a CSV file. If you use a CSV file, make sure to pay close attention to the instructions on how to format your file.  Optionally, you can assign a &quot;Quality&quot; rating to each room, where 1 is best and subsequent numbers are progressively worse - ties are fine, and the scale is open-ended. Tabroom will then attempt to assign the &quot;best&quot; rooms first.  After all the rooms are entered, you'll usually create a &quot;Room Pool&quot; for each event, and potentially separate pools for certain elimination rounds. Creating a room pool is usually as simple as giving it a name and then clicking on the rooms to add to each pool.  For more info, see the section on Sites &amp; Rooms.

The Money section puts these all in one place for easy editing - if the same option exists in multiple places, it doesn't matter where you choose to set it.  You'll want to make sure you have set the entry and judge fees/fines correctly - invoices will be automatically generated based on the numbers you enter.

If you need to manually create entries, you start with Entries - Data, and click &quot;Add a New School.&quot; Fill out the required information, and then that school will be available for adding entries to.  Alternately, if you have complete registration data from another tab program (such as Speechwire), you can import the data into Tabroom by using the &quot;Data&quot; menu option.  Once you have schools, you can access them with the Entries - Schools menu. School's will be listed as &quot;Not In&quot; until they are marked as Registered. Once they are registered at the tournament, they will be in the &quot;In&quot; menu instead.  Each school will have a number of tabs for accessing their general info, entries, judges, and invoice.

In Tabroom, any reason that a judge can't judge a particular debate is considered a &quot;strike&quot; - so you'll have different types of strikes such as a &quot;time strike&quot; or a &quot;competitor strike.&quot;  To add or remove a &quot;strike&quot; for a judge, access their info page, click on the Strikes box in the right corner, and enter the &quot;time strike&quot; or &quot;competitor strike.&quot; Once entered, strikes for the judge will appear on the right side of the page. To remove any strike, click the garbage can next to the time strike or competitor strike on the right side of the page.    Important Note - When adding a time strike for a judge, be careful about the end time you select. If you have your schedule configured such that one round's end time is the same as the next round's start time, then a time strike placed on the boundary will prevent the judge being placed in either round, which is usually not the intended effect. So, for example, if you have Round 1 configured from 8-10 and Round 2 from 10-12, then giving a judge a time strike from 9-10 will prevent them judging either Round 1 or 2, because they are &quot;unavailable&quot; at exactly 10am. To prevent this, configure your scheduled time slots so that Round 1 ends at, for example, 9:30 instead of 10, and then give the judge a time strike from 9-9:55.  One helpful tip - make sure you scan the coaches notes column for each judge group before pairing your first round, as coaches frequently include availability information in the Notes field (e.g. &quot;Not available round 1&quot;) instead of using time blocks correctly.

If you are running a tournament without IE's, you'll really only use the Paneling menu for creating room/judge pools - everything else is done from the schematic.  Regardless of the method, pairing rounds is a three-stage process - Assigning Rounds, Assigning Judges, and Assigning Rooms. In practice, the automatic pairing functions will usually assign rooms at the same time as one of the other steps, so you'll really only need to press two buttons to get a complete pairing.  Before you proceed to pairing rounds, it's usually prudent to double-check your tournament settings - being sure you've configured everything right can save you a lot of headache down the line.

To use, view the round you want to panel in the Schematics menu, then choose &quot;Manually panel round&quot; from the sidebar.  Once your rounds are created, you can assign IE judges with the Paneling - Judges menu option. Use the &quot;Mass Assign&quot; tab to add judges to all your prelims at once:    Rooms for IE events are usually assigned during the pairing step - but if you need to configure room pools or reassign rooms, you can do it with the Paneling - Rooms menu option.  Finally, you can also publish ballots and feedback for rounds in each event from the Paneling tab. To publish ballots, select the Paneling - Web Publish menu option.

To pair the round automatically, use the &quot;Auto-pair&quot; link on the sidebar. The majority of the time, this is all you need to do to have a finished pairing based on the powermatching or preset rules you've set up in your tournament settings.  If necessary, you can use the manual powermatcher instead by clicking the link on the sidebar. This will let you visually create a pairing by viewing the teams in bracket order, and manipulate the pairing however you like.  Once you have a pairing, you can assign judges with the &quot;Auto-assign judges&quot; link. By default, this will try to assign rooms at the same time. If there are no error messages (such as insufficient judges), your pairing should be ready to go.  You also have the option of using the manual judge placer and dragging/dropping available judges into rounds. Most of the time, this is unnecessary - Tabroom usually does a pretty good job of testing out all the available options and coming up with the best fit for judges.  If you're using MPJ, you can see the prefs for each judge right on the schematic - if you then need to change a particular judge, you can click on their name and use the drop-down menus to see other available options.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"MPJ Placement Weights​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Settings - Judging","url":"/settings/judging#mpj-placement-weights","content":" This section controls the &quot;weights&quot; used to compute mutually preferred judging scores. For example, it allows you to control whether the judge placement algorithm privileges &quot;mutuality&quot; more than &quot;preference&quot; or how important it is to try and &quot;save&quot; committed judges for later rounds.    These numbers are not &quot;percentages,&quot; per se - they don't need to sum up to 100. Instead, they are &quot;weighting factors&quot; which are relative to one another.  The following explanation is somewhat technical - if you're not sure how to assign or tweak the MPJ weights, you can just use the default values.  The way MPJ works is by testing out each judge in each round, and computing a &quot;score&quot; for how well that judge fits. Tabroom will then try and find the mix of judges that gives the overall &quot;best&quot; combined score across all debates.  For each round/judge pair, the &quot;score&quot; is computed as the sum of: 1) The difference in mutuality (e.g. in a tiered system a 2-2 = 0, a 1-2 = 1, etc., for ordinals, a 46-38 = 8, a 23-28 = 5, etc), multiplied by the &quot;Penalize non-mutual matches&quot; weight. 2) The total preference (e..g a 1-1 = 2, 2-2 = 4, or with ordinals, a 25-35 = 60), multiplied by the &quot;Penalize low-preferred matches&quot; weight. 3) The likelihood a round of commitment will be lost, raised to the power of the &quot;Avoid burning commitments early&quot; weight. Note that this is an exponent, not a simple multiplication, so this number will likely be much lower than the other weights. 4) The average pref of the judge for all entries, minus the standard deviation of their pref from the average pref of the judge group, multiplied by the &quot;Prefer hard-to-place judges&quot; weight. 5) If in use, adds the &quot;Promote use of diverse judging&quot; weight for &quot;diverse&quot; judges. 6) If used, will increase the score for a Hired judge by the &quot;Prefer hired judges over obligated&quot; weight.  Put in terms of the options on the page:  Penalize non-mutual matches - This weight gets multiplied by the difference in mutuality between the two team's rating for the judge  Penalize low-preferred matches - This weight gets multiplied by the total preference, i.e. the sum of the two team's rating for the judge  Avoid burning commitments early - The likelihood a round of commitment will be lost by placing a judge is raised to this power. Note that this is an exponent, not a simple multiplication, so this number will likely be much lower than the other weights.  Prefer hard-to-place judges - This weight is multiplied by the average pref of the judge, minus the standard deviation of their pref from the average pref of the judge group.  Promote use of diverse judging - This weight control how important the use of &quot;diverse&quot; judges is in the final score.  Prefer hired judges over obligated - This weight is added to hired judges to make it more likely they will be placed than  Stand-in rating for non-preffed judges: - This is not a &quot;weight&quot; used in the MPJ algorithim, but instead is the value used for judges who were not given a pref by a team. For example, if a team only filled out a partial pref sheet, you could choose whether you wanted unranked judges to be a &quot;1&quot; or some other number.  The built-in defaults should work fine for most situations. If you're so inclined, Palmer has this to say about his usual personal defaults for tiered MPJ systems:  Penalize non-mutual matches = 65Penalize low-preferred matches = 20Avoid burning commitments early = 5 (8 if in a very tight judging situation)Prefer hard-to-place judges = 10  For ordinal preference systems, the following weights work well:  Penalize non-mutual matches = 25Penalize low-preferred matches = 10Avoid burning commitments early = 7 (8 if in a very tight judging situation)Prefer hard-to-place judges = 10  If you wonder at some point why it placed judge X instead of judge Y, you can look at an individual round (by clicking on the room number on the schematic), and then click &quot;Judge Pref Report&quot; on the sidebar. This will show you the judge score for all available judges in the debate, so you can see how you could change the weights to achieve a different goal.  For example, if you were getting a lot of 3-3 pref matchups, and would prefer more 1-2's (i.e. increase pref at the expense of mutuality), you could turn down the &quot;Penalize non-mutual matches&quot; score to 50.

This can be useful when experimenting with Tabroom, but it should never be enabled for a real tournament.  Require adult contact info to register - This will ask people registering for your tournament to provide an adult's contact information before proceeding with their registration. This is useful to ensure that you can get in touch with someone responsible, especially if competitors are allowed to attend your tournament unsupervised. Coaches will need to enter a contact name, email, and phone number and hit &quot;Save&quot; before the registration tabs allowing them to add students and judges will appear for them. This contact will receive tournament communications through Tabroom.  Tabroom account based coaches &amp; contacts - This will allow only those with Tabroom.com accounts to be added to and compete in your tournament.  Require second adult contact or coach - This will ask people registering for your tournament to provide a primary and a secondary adult's contact information before proceeding with their registration. If you have also selected &quot;Require adult contact info to register&quot;, Tabroom will require the primary contact to be added before coaches can proceed with registration, but missing a secondary contact will not prevent them from moving forward.  Tournament-wide cap on entries - sets a tournament wide limit on number of entries, not by event.  Log registration changes - This will keep a log on Tabroom (accessible in Entries &gt; Change Log) of changes made to registration, including adds, drops, timestamps, and the account that made the change.  Closed tournament: admin staff registers - This option will disable all online registration. Entries and judges will instead need to be entered manually by a tournament administrator from the Entries menu.  Waitlisted still count for double entry - If you have set entry limits for any event (at Settings &gt; Events &gt; Registration), the default is that coaches can enter waitlisted entries beyond that cap, and those waitlisted entries do not abide by tournament rules regarding double entry. Enable this setting to ensure waitlisted entries cannot be double-entered in events that your tournament settings prohibit.  Use school regions - Toggle this option to enable additional settings at Settings &gt; Events &gt; Pairing that control in-region match-ups and judging within a region. Create and assign schools to regions at Entries &gt; Data. Regions are fully customizable and can be used to separate geographic regions, districts, leagues, etc.  Require disaster check before publishing - Toggle this option to require your tab staff to run disaster checks on every pairing before publishing. We recommend every tournament use this setting to minimize issues with pairing rounds.  Mock Trial Registration - This option is only relevant if you are hosting a Mock Trial event. Please ignore for all speech and debate tournaments.  Ask for refund information - This option will ask registrants to enter refund information during registration. On the General tab of a school's registration, Tabroom will ask who to make refund checks payable to and the address to send refund checks. Refund information can be collected at Entries &gt; Reports &gt; Refund Mailing Information.  NSDA Paid Members only - Toggle to only allow NSDA paid member schools and students to register.  Publish list of registered schools - Toggle to display list of registered schools on tournament's public-facing Tournament Info page on the Entries tab.  Hide Tabroom deadlines from registration view - The default is that registered coaches and students will be able to see tournament deadlines in advance of the tournament. This option will need to be toggled to actually hide deadlines.  Hide Speaker Codes from Registrants - The default is that registered coaches and students will be able to see their speaker codes in advance of the tournament by logging into their Tabroom accounts. This option is used for tournaments who want to disable registrants from knowing codes in advance. This option will need to be turned off the day of the tournament to enable students and coaches to know their codes.  School code style - Tabroom automatically assigns a code to each registered school, and this setting allows you to choose the code style. These codes sort schools on the Entries &gt; Schools dropdown and can be used on public pairings and results if &quot;school code&quot; is included in your selection at Settings &gt; Events &gt; &quot;Entry codes&quot;.  Allow duplicate codes in different events - The default is that an entry's code cannot be repeated across the tournament in any event. For example, the code &quot;Test School AB&quot; cannot exist as both an LD entry and a PF entry, even though those entries have different students. Toggle this option to allow duplicate codes to be used in different events.  Do not avoid ADA /other pools' rooms - The default is that once a tournament designates ADA rooms and specific pool rooms, those rooms are off limits to other events and non-ADA labeled rooms. Toggle this button if you do not want to avoid using ADA rooms and specific pools' rooms.  Do not give schools the option to bring judges - The default for all tournaments is to allow schools to bring judges. Toggle this, if for some reason, you don't need schools to bring judges.  No money/fees screen for schools - Toggle this, if for some reason, you want to hide the money/fee screen from schools.  Allow entry drops on school dashboard - Toggle this button if you want to allow schools to drop entries from the school dashboard. You should, ideally, never use this.  Printout Paper Size - If you plan to print any schematics or reports, this option controls the sizing of those report printouts to fit on your paper.
